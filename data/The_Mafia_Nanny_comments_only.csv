"The art, the character design, the milk mafia child I’m HERE 👏🏻FOR👏🏻 IT👏🏻"
Ok but his son demanding chocolate milk was so adorable
he recognized the name I bet.
We respect the Milkman in this house.
"don't deny it, you thought it spyXfamily when you clicked"
Milk Mafia Child giving Boss Baby Vibes
"""I have demands too..."" MIKEY, YOUR TOO CUTE FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!"
angelini sounds like a pasta
"kid: ""choccy or glocky, you pick"""
"Mafia story ✔️ handsome lead ✔️ power couples ✔️ adorable child,  COUNT ME IN ‼️"
Don’t be such a buzzkill dad and use his proper code name 🤦
i respect The Milkman
Is this the college Mary Poppins went to?! Sign me up!
He’s got so much money but his shirt doesn’t fit
The way I SQUEALED when I saw this on insta 😭
"right off the bat, Mrs. Bremerton is my favorite character archetype: sexy"
"uh, excuse me, Mr. Angelini. without the milk, the negotiation doesn't seem an advantageous one for you. Mikey is right, milk that man some more😏"
I too have demands.
LMAO THIS IS SO FUNNY 😭😭
"OOOH I’m so excited for this already! gorgeous art, interesting characters, advanced driving… looking forward to seeing where this goes! hope she gets her answers and the tiny brat gets his chocolate milk"
GIVE HIM DA MILK🥛🥛 and make it double
Give the child his milk.
"mafia, agent nanny, cute 'milkman' kiddo? OKAY YOU GOT ME I'M SEATED"
NOT A KIDNAPPING ALREADY
Where is everyone
Please just a little romance??🫠
I think this kidnapping is staged. To test how capable she is of caring for his son.
"okay but like mikey being like ""You Need Me."" was actually so cute TT little kids being serious are so silly, I smell a slow burn coming seeing as its 'no romance' in the romance genre"
“No romance” famous last words 😂
What a way to start your first day…
IT'S HER FIRST DAY ON THE JOB LET HER BREATHE FIRST DEAR KIDNAPPERS
They way my 🫁  shrieked DADDY when he locked the car doors. I need therapy.
Headmistress: “No romance.” Entire fandom: *LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY* 🤣🤣🤣
'no romance' bold lol i bet all my savings that one rule will be broken
There are two of them.🤣
Great guards you got on the property!
I hope the kidnapping is just a test.
Boy got kidnapped already and it's just her first day 😭😭
Girl's gonna get fired within 10 minutes on the job? this is a world record
I feel like this is a set up to test her. I mean come on what are the odds the very first day the moment she takes her eyes off him. not to mention he been ran off how did she come out at the perfect time to see them throw him in the van and drive off??
oh no hes hot
The Milkman got his milk!
"well, about safety ... how about we put the four-year-old in a proper car seat? 😅"
He really doesn't have any other security? Some guards maybe? It's not like he's trying to keep a low profile
That’s totally staged to test how skilled she actually is
Are we shipping or sinking??
Cute kid + Badass FL + Hot ML = You have my interest 👀
Mikey: I like her she’s scary and hugged me Me: we got the little one’s approval that’s all I need
Ayyy she passed. A great nanny already Edit: not the mother😭 the test.
did he never wash the ring or
I kinda agree with him. It was better to have the Milkman part of the test.
I wish I discovered this story when there's already 100+ chapters 😭
I love the depictions of their pasts as a ghost that's beside them
I love how she uses the fucking trashcan lid to beat the shit out of two people
"daaang she can get it also the hug when mikey reminds her of  her youngerself TT  adam seemed so cool I was gonna be seriously mad if he really was a rat, happy he wasnt though ^^"
unoficially adopting the child starts now
mickey was surprised that she hugged him but the girl still traumatized about her life dang
"me seeing his wife, i stopped the shipping . she too much beautifull for wanting another couple... learning she was dead... return ship XD"
The kid is soo cute! Honestly don’t blame the dad he is a walking target and his son is his world! I’d test the nanny too nothing personal  ‘|_~_~_|
I need more episodes asap 😩
"I’m a part time nanny myself, and now I think I should get some self defence training."
"Solid start, im interested for now"
Adam better sleep with one eye open at night cuz our girlie is MAD
They're lucky she went in non-lethal.
"“You pass,” No I quit, thank you🤭"
"Hook - line - and SINKER - I’m invested now. Gotta see it to the end, I mean we got a badass independent and strong FL, a hot mafia boss ml and a spunky sassy son that is a whole vibe. Can’t keep me away."
I got invested way too early now I shall bear the consequence of waiting
soo we are talking about the murder of the mother of the child right before the child? ah well i guess the kid is used to crap but still. love how he approves of her tho
wait oof the webtoon is juicy like that turkey I had but okayyy new webtoon starting strong
Mikey definitely takes after his papa when it comes to his attitude.
I love this too much already! The story and art is so captivating.  I can see myself spending coins when it gets to the cliffhangers. 🥲
I’m so excited to see where this goes I love the expressions and the style !!!!
Dude stays in her face 😭 sir let her breathe PLEASE
now I wonder why he **really** wanted her on the task 👀
He just asked her to stay and then threatened her… again. Make up your mind.
What does it mean that she smells like oranges? ...  they already mention it several times 🤔🤔🤔🤔....
"she's a badass AND she can be silly!  Davina is such a doll, even if she does smell like oranges"
"ok i know she's trained for it, but rarely do I see in webcomics such an accurate understanding as to why kids do what they do, as someone who works with kids I'm loving it"
"I noticed how Gabriel manages to close their physical distance every time they talk, he had no need to stay THAT close to Davina yet he did 😌"
“I won’t settle for anyone else” AAAAHHHHH🥰☺️
im sorry but why does mikey remind me of damien but younger and with out trained by assasins? xd
Hmmm... he knows things about her. *OR* He just thought she was pretty? lol
Whomever designed Mr Angelini watched Jojo’s and you’re not gonna convince me otherwise
Bibbity boppity my money is now this webtoons property-
"Reminds me of Nanny McPhee. ""When you don't want me but need me, i will stay. When you want me but don't need me, i will go"".  I love Nanny McPhee."
Bro never heard of personal space 💀
"🗣️THEORY TIME! Now I could be reaching with this one but… I think Mikey might not be his biological son. (HEAR ME OUT☝🏾) Despite being the underboss, why isn’t Angelini next in line and his son is?  Although we have yet to know if Angelini has any siblings or cousins, wouldn’t it make sense?"
"I like how expressive Davina is. A lot of the time, FL's don't get to be so dynamic.   She's a cutie on top of that, looking forward to when she finally gets to let her hair down"
bro if you're so concerned about it then why not choose somebody who specializes in combat ???
CANNOT STOP READING
LONG LIVE MIKEY
WHY DOES MIKEY HAVE A CHOCOLATE MILK ADDICTION!! 🥹😂ITS LIKE A BABY ADULT! WHO CARES ABOUT DRUGS CHOCOLATE MILK FOR THE WIN 🤪
Dont be surprised if it was his own uncle (the don) that killed his wife. I think he wants Mikey to be free from his family. It's like the body guards/employees are watching his every move in the house to report back 👀
There must be spies within his own household. The ml maybe knows the fl when she was child which would make sense why he pick a newbie than a senior. Edit: it’s the comment section not thesis paper or resume…idc about grammar when comes to comments…
The Angelini Family seems to have layers of never ending secrets…
He wants out of the mafia for his son’s sake! I’m soooo invested!!
"I wonder if he tried to get them out before, and that's why they murdered his wife?"
He wants to get his son out. he doesn't want his employees to hear because they will report to the Don. I'm guessing the Don murdered his wife too.
"Ohhhhh he chose her because she grew up part of the life like Mikey, but is also out—HE WANTS HIS SON OUT 😭"
They are definitely adding some tracking/spy software to her laptop.
I bet he wants Mikey to choose his own path :(
I bet every time he leans in close he sniffs. 🍊 👃🏻
He was gonna say “to deal with his chocolate milk addiction”
"Most importantly, why was he being so seductive with it?"
I want Mikey to be free and escape this life!
I honestly want to keep seeing Miley!! He's too cute!! (even the way he acts)
Mafia Boss Gojo is fine af!
This story already has me stressed out. 😅 But I'm excited to see where this goes!
The tension yall THE TENSION!!
Pretty sure ml doesn't trust his own family and can't fight back if they're threatening his son. I mean why is Mikey being groomed as the successor when he's just five...anyways looks like Davina will have a lot more on her hands than just looking after Mikey and I am here for it.
I just wanna hug that little boy
I don't think he wants Mikey to take over the business
"I fully expect to get a ""who did this to you?"" scene because this story is filled with that kinda vibe, if that makes sense"
He told her to act...scared... That is so strange. He is definitely being watched in his own household.
I'm so invested in this I'm dying
Davina empathizes with Mikey because of what she went through as a child🥺
"Oh, poor Mikey. He has to learn how to be a kid and also learn to be like his father but in a different way than he thought. We have a long way to go and I'm willing to stay from the start to the end! Protect Mikey at all costs!!"
Mikey reminds me of Anya from Spy x Family
who else has a sneaky feeling they're monitoring her laptop?
"Old enough to want to be a part of his dad's life, but young enough to not know any better... Smart enough to be involved,  but innocent enough to not see there's a choice."
Poor Mikey. He’s obviously terrified of losing his dad too.
"Leave the gun, take the crayons."
"Oh. Every time his papa leaves Mike fears he might never see him again. At least while they are together, no matter what happens they are still together."
"We noticed the stuffed ""culprit"" in his backpack🤭"
Maybe they should give him ways to listen in/easily contact his father while these meetings occur. Making him go cold turkey isn't gonna work but slowly weaning him off of the mob boss life would be more effective and still make him feel he isn't losing his father.
"somebody knows croatia exists??? 🥰🇭🇷 even if it's a crime syndicate, I feel represented hahah"
It seems she didn't check to see if her laptop was tampered or what they tried to access... 🤔
Poor kid he really thought she’d back him up I feel so bad 😭😭😭
aw poor baby :(
"Mikeys puppy dog eyes in this chapter made me realize how he ends up accessing all those ""off limit""  chocolate milks😂"
if you're so good at cybersecurity why wouldn't you CHECK YOUR LAPTOP FOR ANY BUGS
I hope we get to see more of FLs background and see how she grew up
Ok didn’t expect my heat to be tugged on by Miky dang.
Violet this story is so good already! it will be huge one day! you're doing amazing and thank you
"I love the potential Davina and Mikey relationship has, like she actually understands him to a certain extent and maybe he can open up and vent some of the things that might be overwhelming."
MY HEART!
This boy sounds way way way too serious and mature for his age…
When she was doing her research on the laptop I thought he was right behind her😂
"Not gonna lie, the martini glass just FULL of olives REALLY caught me off guard edit: I’ve been on WEBTOON since I was 12, (now 22) so, thank you all for honoring me with my first top comment Update #5: Marceline the baby queen is now 6 months old and doing phenomenal! She says thank you all you wonderful people for the good wishes, and read Mafia Nanny!!"
Mikey ya lil jerk 😭
Mikey… Yk she gonna find you.
Wow Don loves extra dirty martinis. Honestly that’s an olive salad with vodka dressing
"THAT FACE!!! OMG SOOOO CUTE!!! But then again, was it all just a trick? I think yes!"
"He likes ducks 🥹🫠🪿  Also, I think it's really cool the intense web of Mafia backstory the author has going on. They probably had to do research on relations between different countries and export/import analysis, and we stan an author who does the leg work 👌"
I’m absolutely loving this new series. It’s refreshing right off the bat for me. The art style kind of reminds me of Purple Hyacinth. Anyway! I’m looking forward to reading 🤩
"here you go duckies, don't fight *drops the whole loaf in the fountain and lets them all go to purge*"
"damn, that kid sure is slippery. Davina has her work cut out for her"
This Lil bastard....lmaoooo I love how he tells the duckies not to fight...and then throws the rest of the loaf in and they're all killing each other like seagulls.....
the dirtiest martini I have EVER seen in my LIFE 🤣
New villain prop unlocked - martini glass full of olives.
that man is 100000% the villian.. THAT IS TOO MANY DAMN OLIVES!!!!
Nooo Mikey ducks shouldn’t eat bread its not good for em
My husband is Italian and I can confirm Italians love olives. 🫒  My husband’s grandpa literally eats a bowl of green and black olives with a toothpick as a snack. No juice too.
Oh no... The uncle is hot..
What??? Something ugly hiding below the surface in the home of a mafia boss?? Well no shit! 🙄
Did that driver really just took off with a 4 yr old alone?
Mikey’s Day Out!
"⚠️ Wrong translation : "" Vas à la gare ?"" is not a right sentence it should be ""Vous allez à la gare ?"" or at least ""Tu vas à la gare ?""  (French native speaker here 🇫🇷)"
ultra hide and seek
I was gonna mention something about the olives but I see the comment sections already got that covered
I would like this to get  an anime adaptation this is too good
Burned my coins faster than Mikey’s escape
No I need more!!
"Well. Time to wait for a week as I just fast passed them all and there goes almost all of my coins but it's worth it. But also, I really hope Mikey is still in his room when they open the door..."
"Davina needs to work on the local language, but her driving skills are on point. Also, nice of the author to include a cameo of us, the audience, squeeing over Mikey in his little suit."
I’m torn between him carrying her and her coming awake full protect baby battle mode ha
*sighs* *checks bank account * fuck.
Why do men always look so hot when they are bloodstained? 🥵
"WellI absolutely love everything about this story. The art, the characters, the writing. All great and a joy to read. I can't wait to read more. Thank you for the be fun story. Take care."
Now why is he standing over her like the devil himself
You are a master story teller! I've been at the edge of my seat this whole time. I really look forward to the rest of the story. Keep up your awesome work!
"It's so so good. The writer knows their characters and what gets us hooked, the wit, the dialogues THE STORY, the artist draws expression so perfectly, it's like the pick one word from each speech bubble and draw the mouth like an animator would, the colours, the backdrops. It all fits together so well. It's a great team. I'm completely invested!!"
"Was that ba-dumm like heart palpitations? An ""OMG - she's so pretty & protective over my son like me""? Or was it more of a ""there's gonna be trouble"" ba-dumm??? 👁️👁️"
Her white collar is loose. I wonder if he will see the necklace that she is wearing that was given to her by her parents before their tragic death. Maybe the necklace means something.
uh oh he's got blood on him and his tits are out again
From Mikey's POV it just looks like Davina teleported with her mysterious nanny powers lmao.
I guess the negotiations didn’t go so smoothly…
wsg daddy welcome home 🙏
imagine he just dropkicks her-
Mikey’s Great Escape
NOT ENOUGH EPISODES!!!!!!
THIS is the kind of content I wanna burn cash for on Webtoon 🔥🔥🔥 gives off SpyxFamily vibes SIGN ME UP FOR MORE
He can tuck them both in
Mikey pls still be in ur room🤞🤞
I just really like the fact that he wakes her up and helps her to her room. ☺️
The way he’s just laying there in a speedo is just chef’s kiss 😘
Mikey is really his papa’s twin in that he already knows all details of his papa’s business that he basically considers himself to be his right hand man.
Me expecting just normal bathing suit…not a speedo
"yeah, he def doesn’t like the lifestyle he currently leads and everyone in the house is part of the dons team, not his. his wife probably tried to get mikey away from that life and that’s why they killed her"
the speedo reveal made me burst out laughing
I think we are all going to have a healthy appreciation for pool day.
This muthaf*cker knows exactly what he’s doing 😏
im sorry that end really had me cackling... is he wearing a speedo?😭😭😭
"I feel like he's being overly touchy and close with her on purpose. Theres no way he's oblivious to the proximity he's creating, but I think he's using it as a manipulative tactic. For why, I don't know, likely to do with why he picked her and what plans he clearly has for her... Just scared she's gonna get hurt, but it'd be funny if he accidentally caught feelings first."
Sir? Sir? put some pants on oh my God 😭
literal jumpscare omg
I really appreciate that the artist went with a European accurate swimsuit. Helps with the uhm continuity or something.
Mikey really loves to get on Davina’s nerves whenever possible…
I died at the pool scene 🤦‍♀️
Ngl if that was me I would've been so shocked💀
When will he fall for her?!?? I’m dying here 😭😭😭
I almost feel like he's trying to find a wifey. And he's testing her to see if she has the mettle.
Daddy…
well isn't he getting awfully close to her 🥴
bro is laying with rizz
"Oh, hello. How many days per week is pool day? Whatever it is isn’t enough. 😎"
I was gagged to say the least
"the ""isn't this access enough?"" 😂😂"
Is this about a Mafia Nanny or Speedo Daaddy...? Please. Tell me. 😏😆
idk why but the forced fun is so funny 😂
lol I love that book he's reading
Y'ALL SAW THE WAY HE LOOKED RIGHT👀
“How to raise your kids RIGHT while doing WRONG” 😂😂😂 the book he’s reading
Yep he was definitely gawking and flirting for those few seconds!!
Someone was looking at the hot nanny 👀
NO CUZ WE 👏🏼 NEED👏🏼 TO 👏🏼 SEE 👏🏼 HER👏🏼 WITH 👏🏼 HER 👏🏼HAIR 👏🏼 DOWN 👏🏼 MORE 👏🏼OFTEN 👏🏼
Mikey was too cute diving for rings. First actual kid activity I’ve seen him do!
NOT THE BOOK ABOUT RAISING KIDS RIGHT WHILE DOING WRONG
this webtoon is so good and criminally short but I'm going to fast pass every week anyway like the simp for speedo daddy that I am thankyaplease
"I feel like her parents death has to do something with his late wife, maybe that’s why he wanted her as the nanny. She might be the only person he can trust because everyone in that house is sus :/"
"There has never been any question that this man loves his son. The entire staff being terrified of Pool Day rules is hilarious ""I won't be tricked into entering again!"""
Um sir… where are you looking?!
"Sir, I see where your eyes are. Glasses or no glassses."
"Well, someone doesn't respect the sanctity of pool day. I bet it's the uncle."
"I volunteer to invited to the next pool day. I too need full access, sir"
Ahaha the maid who got tricked on pool day 🤣😂
Mafia nanny? More like mafia mommy
Mikey: did u see that papa. Papa: what you think me blind of course I saw the hot lady doing a perfect dive.
"""You promised me full access!"" ""Isn't this enough access to you? 😉""  The scream I scrumpt!! 🤣"
“Raising kids right while doing wrong” - gentle parenting for gangsters
"Can we talk about how how adorable Davina cheering up Mikey was? He was so resistant to it at first, but you could see him warm up to it. And Davina’s play acting was so freaking cute. I love them."
The trickle down his chest tho 😳😏
He need to be worried about the effect she's having on him cause I know that water down his chest did sumn 😏
OMG THAT WATER-DROP WAS A PAYED ACTOR 😭💅
I don't understand what the big deal is. I feel like her elite nanny school would've definitely gone over organized crime
"""how does a nanny--"" YOU HIRED AN ELITE NANNY!! YOU HIRED PEOPLE WHO ARE KNOWN TO KNOW AND HANDLE THESE THINGS, WHAT KIND OF QUESTION --"
I just love the way he looks at her when she's not looking
“don’t be wet”  in what way mafia daddy😏😏
Mans was checking her out. Twice.
Uhm bc she is well trained and well versed in everything sir
"What he meant: ""Incredible. She's defied my orders and is wet in my office. Ehem. 😳 When I strictly told her not to be."" 🤭🤭🤭"
“how does a nanny know so much about organized crime?” she literally comes from an elite academy where YOU hired her from😭😭
"Mikey’s smirk as he is pushing Davina into the pool. She will do anything to protect Mikey from seeing the “Dirty Business” involved with his papa’s business, and from getting putting in harms way."
this webtoon updating was the best part of my birthday. i love how Davina cheered up Mikey and how he warmed up to it. and the trickles of water down Gabriel’s chest 👀
Y’all saw his eyes go 😏 right I’m not crazy?
The nanny knows about organised crime because the nanny is with the group called kindergarten! A very expensive and well known mafia run by children so of course she knows! Gotta keep those child bosses safe 👁️👄👁️
The question is.. how come YOU sir don't know anything about her. Her real name is on the application.  Duplicate names should have been X-referenced and that would have shown that she's a product of A and not THE Mafia family as well.
My my… i really want to see how this guy falls for this young lady with her being oblivious  to it 🤗🫢😊🥰🌸❤️
That exhale was so yummy hahaha! Also it’s becuase she was part of the mafias too.
"""incredible"" her or the computer program cause it sounds like you mean the former"
“I’m simply one hell of a butler” vibes 😏 love it
"When Gabriel was zooming in on the camera on that guy's tattoo and said I couldn't go further. i feel like Gaberiel is testing Davina's skills. cause Gabriel as a mafia member knows how to detect someone and get clues, its as if he is testing Davina's knowledge on the mafia matters out."
silly little cartoon man has no business being so fine...???
"I won't lie, ""is it your outfit?"" REALLY caught me off guard 💀💀"
I am vaguely and indefinitely distraught over uncle drinking that like juice edit: yall my lovelies sweet beautiful people there's no inherent issue with drinking olive brine. do your thing. this guy is using his god forsaken gloved hands to pull out olives of said brine and then *spitting* pits into it and drinking that.
"Yes, he knows. Question is does Davina know."
"Dear Writer, I’m completely hooked into your story.  Take your time and let this romance, suspense thriller unfold properly. I’m in love with the art , the characters and the plot."
"Something is telling me that Gabriel made a scene with accusations to give her access to his internal network, but he knows she is not a part of mafia or mercenary. Probably it has something to do with the staff in the house and how “someone is always watching” them, so he chose to be sneaky. I might be wrong tho"
that uncle's obsession with olives is more disturbing to me than being a don at this point...
"Dang! So his uncle is the reason for his wife's death?!?, Brutal!!"
The way he kept grabbing on her 😉🫣
First it was the martini glass full of olives and now the brine. . . tell me the character is unhinged without saying the character is unhinged
He has the power to ruin her...💀😳
I hope Davina can install a software that reverses the initial one and collect info
why are you getting your gloves all nasty dude?
"Well, then, this is a different type of test from what she guessed—and I’m thinking uncle is truly their mutual enemy at this point."
I’m leaning towards the theory that the uncle definitely had something to do with Gabriel’s wife 🤨🤨
He knows but the nanny doesn’t 😭😭 let’s hope she doesn’t get into some trouble
The way he grabbed her face…I shouldn’t be feeling the way I do man
"USE A FORK, YOU MONSTER. also obsessed with her forcing herself not to laugh at ""You're a mercenary?!"" dhjdjdjdnf"
Davina had to put her acting skills to work when she was being interrogated by Gabriel on her knowledge on organized crime.
Can I just say the art is absolutely phenomenal aside from the plot 😍
This is too good to not be a book. In other words...more! I must  have more! 🤪
"i'm still curious as to why gabriel was so adamant in choosing davina as his son's nanny to begin with, yet he seemingly shows that he doesn't know who she is. so he must know about her background and is playing along with her story for the meantime, in order to eliminate who is spying on and threatening his family, since she acts as a wild card they don't have intel on... idk. i'm too hooked by the plot lol"
"I SQUEALED when he nudged her chin up, then kept his hand there. SQUEALED, I tell you."
Did he…did he just down a glass of olive juice 🤣
AGENT BEAK AND THE MILKMAN 😂😂😂🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵
"He found a loophole and using it. Davina, you’re in for one hell of a ride"
Davina is playing checkers while Gabriel is playing chess and already outsmarting Davina at her own game.
Mikey don't just sneak in while your parents fight 🤭
I respect her professional ability to not interpret the competition between them as sexual tension.
Petition for the author to release all the chapters at once. The story is too engaging and making me impatient 😭
She's not done. 100% she is gonna come back with her own loophole for him making her do this. And I am 100% her for the smug look on her face when she traps him.
"I feel like he might know about her past, or has some sort of connection to it. The loophole theory is likely a good cover for how much he knows."
him bringing her dinner :))) the subtleties in body language and acts of service >>>
Me studying abroad: *being very croatian bc i am indeed croatian* Me reading this webtoon: THOSE DARN CROATIANS
"the way he holds Mikey at the end, so cuuute!"
no. he want you help him get rid of his family because he wants some one how hate his family
this is unrelated to the episode but Happy New Year everyone!
I still feel like Davinas in control here - she’s playing with that fake narrative of her being a hacker on the dark web to get more info from him. Loving watch her play the long game & I wanna see her uncover all the secrets on that tablet !!
this slowburn is eating so baddddd
"Gabriel is playing with his cards close to his chest. He’s letting her think he’s gonna use her for the organization, but his real purpose is to get his son out of their control. After all it could be the uncle setting things up to look like Bratva or Croatia. We know they’re under surveillance and I’m sure Gabriel does too. Now wouldn’t a hacker be the one to hire as a ‘nanny’ in order to find loopholes in the surveillance so Gabriel can do things on the side without uncle’s knowledge??"
Mikey is feeling left out of the top secret conversation🥺
But is she gonna mention the spyware?!?!?
"honestly with his wife being murdered he's probably got an ulterior motive beyond advancing his family's ""business""."
Mikey has one KEEN mf EYE 👁️‼️‼️ good thing his daddy’s smarter 😏
Don't worry Davina. He won this battle. He can still lose the war.
Pretty sure Davina won’t be expanding a crime syndicate. But she might need to dismantle 1-3 of them to keep Mikey safe. I bet that’s what Gabriel wants too.
damm gabriel she didn't even move a piece and you already checkmated her
“And how do you support your father’s enterprise?” Fastest way to make friends!
STOP I LOVE LOUIS AND HIS SAILOR SUIT ALREADY
Davina literally dragging Mikey to art class 😂
"“Be kind to the other children.” “Why? The world won’t be.” OOF what a realist, this kid is a gem"
Mikey is all business. I died at it’s a start to the kid who brushed his teeth 😂
"Mikey radiates Boss Baby energy everywhere he goes, and he very much knows it!"
Protect Louis at all costs! That boy exudes golden retriever energy. 🐶
"""Who's your role model?"" A little kid from a cartoon with atrocious social skills but a heart of gold who wants to be a mafia boss when he grows up and has an immaculate sense of style. ...Why are you looking at me like that?"
I can’t wait for Mikey to paint Davina something
"Mikey looks so AGHAST at ""You think I'd wear LINEN to a PARTY?!"" oh my god I love him!!!!!!!"
"did you like it ""I'll have to come back next week"""
"""Louis needs guidance on shading."" 😂🤣 Sure, Mikey, that's why."
The other moms fawning over Mikey in his little suit! Another cameo of the fans! 😂
So what did he mean when he was disappointed she went cold but that he needed her even though he couldn't afford distractions????? Bro I gotta know.
"I was afraid to start reading this in case it was just another toxic relationship story. But I couldn't have been more wrong. The FL is so cool and not a pushover, the ML is intimidating but not unreasonable, and his looks do not contradict his personality (there's nothing more offputting to me than a really handsome but completely despicable ML that we're supposed to be rooting for). There's plenty of humor and action too, I love it."
"Being tailed by someone probably after Mikey’s life ASIDE, seeing him (sort of) get along with other kids warms my heart!"
ooh really? no distractions? just you wait 😏
Omg the way Mikey rolled into art class big pimpin it then immediately took on a protective mentoring role towards the other kid 🥹
“Be kind.” “Why? The world won’t be.” Dammmnnnn that was the Milkman talking
That undershirt is doing God's work 🔥
Mafia daddy- “I dont need distractions” 😪 while thinking of Davina …. Davina (on the other hand) - wishing Mikey would make friends 🤗
"lol Davina should have told Mikey that blending in with the kids will help his father, and then he'd treat it like a mission and actually listen to her 😅"
"""Be kind to the other children."" ""Why? The world won't be..."" As a new mom, my heart breaks for this poor kid. I just want him to have all the love, happiness and safety by the end of this."
I’m so desperate for the nanny and mafia man to shack up 😭
Not the GNOMES 😦
Confirmed Mikey has a phobia of garden gnomes.
"Why hellooo there Niccolo 😘 i suspect you are an insane red flag, but I look forward to seeing your face- I mean your work. 😌"
i hope nico will flirt with the nanny and the dad gets jealous🥰
“Luck had nothing to do with it.” OH HE KNOWS
All I took away from this ep is that there’s two more hotties joining the fam yay!
I really hope that bit about her being good at jumping out of cars IS NOT foreshadowing… it’s probably foreshadowing.
She's like Mary Poppins on steroids. Absolutely brilliant!
It was the uncle. And Mikey holding on to his daddy’s neck. ❤️ He may act like a tough kid but he is still a kid who thinks his dad hung the moon. I love their relationship. And he knows why Davina is working for him. He knows. And she’s still acting cold and professional with him. I am sooooooo ready to get back to that delicious tension between the two.
"1. The uncle can suck it 2. The driver playing match maker is cute 3. Mikey is letting the nanny touch him, even sits on her lap. Progress 4. Nico Is FINNEEE"
Davina’s talent : cyber security and jumping out of moving vehicles 😤🚘
"God this story is just so satisfying. The art, the dialogue, the tension. I love their qualities so much so I’m curious how it will play out as they really get to know one another."
No one’s going to ask about this “doctor” and her “wet work”? Just what exactly tf is this uncle up to and why is mafia zaddy the one with enemies???
Can't wait for Mikey to grow to care for and genuinely love Davina 🥺
nah mikey has his priorities straight gnomes are straight up nightmare fuel💀🙏
Mikey steals the episode each week with an incredibly random line 😂
"I only saw the side profiles of Nico and Val and I’m already down bad, can’t wait for them to wreak havoc!"
This is one of those webtoons where I glance a the side scroll bar and become filled with despair the closer it gets to the bottom.
Okay s000…he already knows her past. I’d bet coins.
"""she jumps out of cars like a champ"" OMG???😭"
"Niccolo and Valentine, bipanic."
We have growing artist here 😍 The change in Gabriel’s expression when he saw Mikey’s drawing of his mother 🥹❤️ Too pure.
Mikey has the confidence of a 50 yr old with money and a god complex
"Not Davina running several blocks, shot, and in heels but still making it faster than everyone else. She is tough"
Davina as an Elite Nanny is just built different
"I gotta say, I saw the painter teacher as suspect, but not the other nanny, lol."
my favorite part has to be Mikey screaming NOOOOO!!! after seeing Davina getting shot 😭😭😭 the boy loves her already!
going absolutely feral thinking about dad in the next episode showin a concern over his pretty lil nanny getting shot
"Mikey’s face when he said “How nice for you,” when the boy said his maman picks out his clothes ☹️💔"
"Those poor kids! Nothing says trauma like the scary art teacher pulling out a gun, kidnapping your classmate and watching the classmate’s nanny get shot right in front of you! Those therapy bills are gonna be through the roof!"
"Dear author, you are being prosecuted for an ILLEGAL CLIFFHANGER! [siren sounds]"
"i love how its clear this chapter how, despite everyone having acted like davina is replaceable, everyone was super concerned for her. mikey was legit destraught she was shot. and even the driver was like, ""leave saving mikey to the others, your injured"" and u just know that the dad is going to be PISSED his fave nanny was shot next chapter"
I just know Davina will faint in the next chapter from her wound and Daddy Mafia will catch her
UGLY GOON LMAO MIKEY DID NOT COME TO PLAY
The mafia genes are so strong 😭
guess I'l have to wait to see Nico and Val's action til next week 🥲
"Nanny protec, nanny attac, nanny has got Mikey’s bac"
i love the piiiiiiiii....iiiiiinnng affect indicating the ringing in the ear sound after being shot point blank. nice
mikeys got a big mouth for being such a little guy 😭🙏
I'm sensing a first aid/concerned argument/princess carry moment coming up between nanny and mr.mafia 🙏
I CANT BE LEFT WITH THAT UNTIL NEXT WEEK😭
Good lord the last panel!! 🔥🔥🔥 and Davina is ofc a champ! ❤️✨
"MIKEY, THEY HAVE GUNS JUST SHUT UP!!!!"
i know it’s really not the moment but is louis okay? 🥺
Noooo his art class!! 😭
"""- I can walk. - And I can carry you."" made my heart skip a beat 👉👈"
"Nico, sir, YOU ARE SO HOT"
Davina is right Mikey and his papa are indeed “cut from the same cloth”. There is no doubt that Mikey is a future Mafia Boss like his papa.
"Being beat by a nanny with a child on her back, who is also shot, is WILD"
Mikey was ready to fight but the next moment he is attached to Davina like a baby kangaroo haha love the little boy
We manifested Gabriel carrying Davina so hard it actually happened 🙌
I love tension between hot people
"I don't feel like Nico or Val are their friends. If anything they just invited new enemies or should I say ""enforcers"" into their house."
One of the most original and fun concepts on WEBTOON right now. Quickly becoming a favorite of mine!
"Was this confirmation about her parents supposed to be news? I reckon Davina was just in some level of denial about it, possibly bc her nanny seemed to be trying to protect her from any further exposure to the mafia world. If Gabriel hadnt insisted on her, I think nanny headmistress would have picked a less risky family for her to work with for sure"
"So her name is Davina Diavolo, assuming based on the last little snippet?"
Yes we have another hotheaded redhead but Val…😳
"Mikey trying to square up is killing me, yall. Look at him in his suit, fists up xD And then everyone else is so hot??? The GALL to do this to me"
davina’s dad tho 👀
"""I can walk"" ""And I can carry you"" SIR YES SIR!"
Can I submit a request for a flashback from Gabriel’s POV of that carry and taking care of Davina please 🙏
Take my coins just take them
Nico’s hair is the same color as Davina’s dad. And Val must’ve known D’s mom. Is Nico related?!
"I'll take the red head, I'm being so dead ass rn 😂😂💀"
"I just love the panel of Mikey all ready to fight and the next one Davina taking him out of danger, totally describes their relation 😂"
adam giving the new guys the run down on the new nanny and sounds like singing her praises. its nice seeing that everyone appreciates davinas dedication
Davina Diavolo. Perfect mafia name 🤌
"Giiiiirl, it’s not like you didn’t know, this is just confirmation ."
"Genuinely one of the most engaging plots and lovely artwork I’ve seen in quite some time, so invested!! And poor Mikey, hope he gets to experience being a carefree child and does not stay jaded at such a young age 😭😭💜"
I’m ready for this blond kid to be Davina’s cyber security archrival ☺️
"NOOOOO MIKEY 😭😭😭😭😭, (rip his duck thou dood got his soul crushed out of him, Mikey's first victim....probably 💀)"
Why do I have a feeling little Miss. Missing Mama isn’t actually missing 🤔🤨
"Davina wants to protect kids and Mikey wants to protect their mommas. If that isn’t a mother son duo in the making…  Also, why didn’t Davina cover up her cyber footprint? Or do we think she’s playing a Trojan horse y’all?"
"I think Gabriel chose Davina because he knew her in the past. Those parties Davina mentioned at the beginning, her parents involved in the world of crime might as well mean the people who attended those parties were from the same world. It's quite probable Angelini attended as well. Val saying that Davina reminds her of someone she used to know means that she has known her mother pretty well. Now we know Val and Nico worked with Gabriel up until a year ago. It's all connected from the beginning."
"Hopefully, Gabriel’s goal for Mikey is for him to have a good childhood and a safe adulthood outside of the Mafia. That poor kid needs to have some happiness. 😟"
"I had this thought from early on that Gabriel's marriage was arranged and that his wife was on a mission. She then failed her mission (which might have included betraying Gabriel) and once she went ""missing"" Gabriel went looking for her, found her, but also found out the truth, or rather the big lie she was part of. She might've died as a result. That could be a good reason why he's suddenly so protective of Mikey and another reason why the whole incident with his wife has left him so devastated"
Davina can relate to Mickey’s pain of losing a parent 😭
"Poor Mikey. It’s clear who “took” his mom, but he’s falling right into their hands by wanting to become a powerful underboss. Hopefully Davina didn’t leave too many clues as to who she was when she hacked into their encrypted servers. She did search her own family, but maybe she threw in a bit of opsec as well."
Anyone else think the mom staged her kidnapping..?
I'm really confused as to why Davina was so not careful with her cyber snooping. She was accessing sensitive content and wasn't even sure where everything was being mirrored to.
is Mikey's mom really alive? This question could complicate the plot
what if the mom is alive and Gabriel hired Davina because her specialty is finding people
i love the she literally just woke up from being shot and severe blood loss and she already has more awareness of mikey than these two about him hiding and listening in
In the beginning Gabriel said his wife died yet all they have left is a ring. Even In the first ep he said the mom WASNT AROUND. I'm starting to think the wife left willingly like a divorce or was taken so Gabrielle can be under the bosses thumb!
"I DO think Mike’s mom is dead, my biggest question is what does Gabrielle want Davina For? Everybody acts suspiciously around her, wether Gabrielle saying things like “her sharp instinct is something she gonna need for what comes ahead “ or Adam and Nico reminding her she’s not gonna leave. The faces Val and Nicco made at the panel where Davina wonder what are they not telling her say a lot."
DAVINA COMFORTING MIKEY IM BAWLING BRUH😞😞💔💔
I just know somethings about to go wrong😭
guys do you think that there will ever be a time jump to when Mikey's older? I can totally see this story taking that turn
I also find Julia (the maid) kinda suspicious👀👀👀
I wonder if Gabriel didn’t want to be underboss because of his wife & Mikey but because he was starting to take a back seat to the family business “something” happened to his wife. Then he was forced to become underboss to protect Mikey / he was promised he’d get his wife back if he became underboss but all he got was the ring? Idk just thinking of the way his uncle asked how Mikey was then said “let’s keep it that way” kinda suspiciously when Gabe said “good” a few episodes back.
Poor Mikey… so young and knows too much
So.... Am I the only one wondering why His cousin is his twin??
"something tells me it won't be ""just this once"""
Hes holding her hand…
“jUsT tHiS oNcE” my ass
I wonder if he’s testing her now and wants to see how far she can go into finding someone
Mikey and Davina sneaking in ninja masks is making my heart melt
The plot thickens… really wondering how many of the issues they are encountering are inside jobs from the Uncle. Seems like his task about the cousin could be a threat
"""Just this once,"" said the liar. Sharp, crystal blue gaze trained on her as he clasped her hand between his own. The gesture--albeit small--belying his words, for a lie was still a lie..."
I thought man was just giving her an autographed picture of himself💀
I'm curious about if the wife isn't dead but instead trapped with this crazy man and they just pretend she's dead for the sake of Mikey. Or he definitely killed her and then is holding someone else close to him hostage. I bet this was a punishment of some sort. Like they tried to leave the family and that's why this all happened.
Not only did he not tell her to stop snooping.. he wants to test just how far she can go
Cute how the Angelinis are all named after angels.
Davina and Mikey are partners in crime!
am i the only one who doesn't trust anything Gabriel does lmao
if my high school lit class taught me anything it was that the shadows in that last panel are a bad sign🥲
"Nah, those ominous colors at the end are not giving “just this once” 😭😭"
"ok but the fact that devinas security meddling got him into hot waters with his uncle, but he doesnt punish her for it, or even bring it up in a ""don't do this"" kind of way??? how hes now protecting her as well as mikey???"
What if… What if Mikey isn’t his son but he’s raising Mikey as his son? And was the wife really his wife?  This look alike cousin has me thinking…
"orchestra please sing with me!!!! "" why you lying? why you always lying?"" LOUDER"
That maid was scarier than Gabriel himself! 😅😂😂😂
What is this lewd hand holding?!?!?!
"Isn't that Gabriel himself in the picture?Same face,hair and even costume😏As far as I remember,in chapter 6 there was Gabriel's family tree but with no picture of his ,,cousin"". There was only a woman on his uncle's side.So I guess there is no male ,,cousin"" at all.I also think maybe that's a picture of Gabriel's father(or uncle) when he was younger cause they both look alike idk😅we still don't know what their names are🤔Anyway, my question is what is Gabriel planning?👀👀"
The yes ma’am scene is so relatable. It reminds of my grandma in a good way 🥰
We got so much this chapter. Gabriel shaking because he knows what he has to do. Davina and Mikey being ADORABLE while making a volcano. Davina blushing!! Can’t wait to see what’s up with the cousin.
"Gabriel needs a hug, and my arms are open.🤗 Edit: Y'all are horny. And also neglecting to consider that a hug would put your face right next to his chest (or bring HIS face to YOUR chest, depending on the position)."
I guess we can just ignore the no feelings rule right?
"Damn, having to betray your family, for your family, to save your family."
I'm so worried about his cousin!!! 😬 He seems like he just wanted a different life. 😢
It just sucks that this is how his uncle keeps control of him. He probably killed his wife
Soooo...is no one going to talk about the torture house they built in their backyard? 😬
"awww, man so Davina just unknowingly helped Gabriel kidnap a non-mafia relative? 😭🥺"
Atp it's so obvious that Gabriel gets a bit too close than normal to Davina on purpose 🥰🥰🥰
"I'm wondering if Nico makes a move on Davina at some point... would make things a bit interesting... nonetheless, I am LOVING all the characters"
"Oh man, and to think Davina helped him because she thought he was worried for his cousin. And Gabriel clearly feels bad about what he needs to to. Um, Davina’s arm in the first panels is not in a cast lol"
“How to raise kids right while doing wrong” - umm did Gabriel miss the chapter where it said not to build a torture shed in his backyard?? 😬
Gabriel shaking caught me off guard
Davina’s going to be so pissed when she finds out Gabriel used her
"The “I never asked to be Angellini” really struck a cord with Gabriel. Poor cousin, he’s a goner."
I feel that Davina will actually encourage Mikey to below up the house…
"Gabriel hasn’t asked Davina to find his wife. So, my guess is he already knows. 6 feet under, hiding safely somewhere, captive, or traitor. Bet’s on traitor."
"Do I see a tinge of pink on Gabriel's cheeks every time he's close to Davina!? Hers was definitely a blush, but he hides it so well. 🤭🥰"
"Hmmm I have a feeling that he kinda knew who Davina was before he actually met her. All these comments about him trusting her, so and so, is making me lean towards the theory that he knew who she was maybe?"
Goggles FIRST! Mikey's scrunched up face and Davina's reaction got me 🤣💀
Why do I have a feeling that Davina is going to walk in on something she shouldn’t and immediately regret helping Gabriel 😩😭
"""Sleep soundly if you can""...yes daddy"
Davina looks like Anastasia in her lil pajamas 🥰
Davina…babe…you knew you were dealing with the mafia. Did you think he was going to ask him out for coffee?
Davina is definitely going to do everything in her power to protect Mikey from knowing the truth about his dad’s shady actions.
NOOOO shes going to hate himmm 😭 I hope she ends up realizing he didnt want to do it either. I’m glad gabriele still has a heart but I hope he’ll be able to escape this life. For both him and mikey
I really feel bad about the cousin. he just wanted to live a life free from the mafia. i’m sure gabriel understands this because i feel like he tried to leave before too and that’s why we see him feeling guilty and poisoning his cousin because he doesn’t want him to suffer. poor davina. she just got reminded she works with the mafia.
"I love how real the characters are. Gabriel realizes how horrible his life is and legimately finds himself caught up between wishing to escape but also protect his son, which makes him so humanly broken and ambivalent. Davina, on her end, does not try to sugarcoat/romanticize anything about the Angelinis just because of her affection for Mikey and her underlying attraction to Gabriel, and stays true to her values and humanity. There are no hearts and flowers, just reality. This story is just🤌🏻"
"she is NEVER going to trust him again. as she shouldnt, he betrayed her trust to do something truly horrible. meanwhile gabriel did this because he was covering for davinas hacking into his uncles system because she risked her life to save Mickey on a bad call he made having to let mikey continue going to art class. the DRAMA of it all is SO DELICIOUS"
Poor Gabriel 😞 Having to choose between your immediate family and extended family is barbaric. Man's still got a heart of gold deep down. Can't wait till his Uncle gets his comeuppance!
Did they kill his wife because he wanted to leave?
I wouldn't be surprised  if what he injected will make his cousin appear dead
Gabriel obviously did NOT want to do this—which is why he risked the uncle’s further ire to inject cousin with something to assure the poor guy wouldn’t suffer long—he just has ZERO choice to protect Mikey. What a 💩 position to be in 😭
aw man it sucks that she’ll feel so guilty about it and also think that he probably wanted to do it even tho he didn’t :(( excited too see the birthday card tho <3
Girrrlll he didn't get that hot body and intimidation skills from working a desk job. Proud of the author for showing the dark side even if it killed a bit of the sexual tension buzz.
"Even if it’s mafia y’all she has a right to be upset. Him killing people and him USING her to kill people are two very different things to be upset about. Honestly, I love angst so"
"kinda pisses me off cuz yeah he involved her in the murder of someone (who probably would have been found and killed anyway) but that guilt, though she didn't know what she was doing, will be there forever"
My baby catching her first body indirectly lol 😭! Dark humor aside Gabrielle was really covering for her because Davina hacked into that system and got caught! Davina Is amazing  but she was too confident in thinking a big time mafia wouldn't notice her
"This will hit Davina so hard, she’ll feel so guilty. She thought she was helping Gabriel find his dear cousin but no.. poor Davina, she never wanted to be a part of it so deeply"
Davina and Gabriel's dynamic is about to get real interesting
This isn’t helping my ship get built any faster…
"""no immediate family to be punished in your stead.""  Yeah..his uncle is responsible for the disappearance of his wife. 10/10 Gabriele tried something and was reminded there was no way out."
"Ah, what an amazing story. It doesn't shy away from mafia brutality, tough deadly choices, hopelessness, when the only mercy you can show even your family member is swift death. We had all these lighthearted chapters where one could even start romanticizing mafia life until it all came crashing down with a reality check. Superbly done."
Oh poor baby I hope this isn’t a mental burden for the duration of this series
My heart is breaking for all of them. Davina thinks Gabriel has no feelings about what he did. Gabriel hated having to do it and made sure to make it quick so his cousin wouldn’t suffer as much. This can only mean trouble for everyone involved
Me: *twiddles thumbs* so when is the romance going to start romancing??
You can tell Mrs. Bremerton really cares ab our baby gurl as if she were her own daughter and I’m glad ab that it’s so wholesome ☺️🫶
Ominous last panel….
Hopefully a sincere conversation with Gabriel is coming
Anyone notice how happy Mikey has been lately? He smiles a lot more than he did in the beginning of the series. If Davina left I fear it would absolutely annihilate what is left of his little heart. I also find it strange Davina isn't watching Mikey but he is instead being watched by other family nannies. Which are not to be trusted as far as you can throw them.  I know Davina wants out but I fear the only way she will be able to leave is if she is dead. She would be a liability if she left.
Okay but she looks so pretty in that outfit 😭
"Everyone hates it here. And judging by that last panel, Davina is about to get a “get a grip” speech."
Did Gabriel blush when smiling at her????
Mikey and davinas dynamic has grown so much. its so cute how he values her opinions and listens to her. and the fact he painted his dad with a mustache like she suggested SO CUTE. and them just chilling together reading a book. despite everything going on and how she feels she clearly loves him so much
Davina is literally like: you’re smiling at me? you killed a man and you’re smiling at me?!?
ok but gabrielle not wanting his uncle to know where he hired a nanny? that coupled with how back in chapter 1 he IMMEDIATELY picked Davina despite her zero experience makes me think he knows more about her backstory.
would you like some vodka with your glass of olives sir?
Anyone else notice how the bad guy had extra dirty martinis? Oh the symbolism!
“People will know we overwork you” I’m dead
DavinaI definitely at a crossroads. Does she stay and protect Mikey or does she protect her own mental wellbeing by leaving…
Oh this is not going to end well. Though it’s interesting to see Gabriel thank her secretly and worry about her when she runs off
"Can we please appreciate Gabriel’s face from the moment where he tells davina to lie?those are purest expressions we have ever seen of him haha, hope to see more of that..  Oh and davina girl run! In that family you stay or leave dead!"
I've been waiting a week for a new chapter and it's over in a minute 😭 how am I supposed to live now
"Not Gabriel looking at Davina and blushing like a teenager who has a crush in that situation,,, like man read the room will ya ? 🤨"
Why do i have a feeling that Gabriel and Davina met when they were kids🤭
Bremerton is just the sweetest mother figure she makes my heart melt 😭😭
Anybody else think the solution to our problem is a nice poison jar of olives?
"You can't ignore that smile and look on Gabriel's face! Also, the way he said her name, wondering what made her leave. It appears he already developed some feelings for Davina. However, unless he kept his cousin alive, I don't see how Davina will forgive him. Her behaviour is completely understandable when someone's life literally stands between them now. I wonder what role Nico will play in all this. I literally can't wait for next episode."
“No one is paying attention to you no one but Gabriel”. 😳😳
"I like how upfront he’s starting to be, she can’t find out what she wants to without getting somewhat involved. Even though she’s been through tough training she still seems very unsettled by this stuff."
A cliffhanger that ends once again with Davina having to make a difficult decision that could only affect her but Gabriel and Mikey as well.
"Mickey will be devastated if she leaves. At least he gave her a choice, in or out. Their chemistry is amazing. I believe they know each other from when they were younger."
i just LOVE how much mikey and davinas relationship has progressed. he loves her so much my heart cant handle it 😭❤️
"i’m glad she got a wake up call. i hope she can grapple with it quickly because mikey needs her, whether she wants to stay or not. i hope she might realize mikey isn’t the only one who wants her to stay"
"I am so happy that we saw this conflict instead of dancing around it! You could cut the tension with a knife. Both of them are pissed at the other and so tense, and both feel so guilty."
"“night, ‘vina.” IM GONNA CRY HES ADORABLE"
"We love good communication 👏👏👏 Tough words to hear, but a healthy relationship through and through."
"I feel so bad for Davina :( I can’t imagine how much she now blames herself. On the bright side, I’m glad Mikey is hanging out with kids his age."
"Ah, how much has changed since Chapter 14, when he noticed she was cold but did nothing. Now, he's actively trying to find out why she's upset and communicating. *chef's kiss* character development"
Well it would have been helpful if he’d shared that tidbit before giving her access…
Val and Nico in the background 🤣🤣
They need to stop having these chats outside of Mikey's bedroom
CAN WE PLEASE TALK ABT HOW HE WAS KEEPING AN EYE ON DAVINA ALL EVENING AND THEN WHEN HE WENT TO CONFRONT HER ABT IT HE SAID “WE CANT SHOW WEAKNESS.” HE SAID WE 😆😆😆😆🤭
"Okay, after re-reading through the comic, I have a few points. First, Gabriele is almost certainly lying about how much he knows about Davina. He didn’t select her for her cybersecurity skills, he didn’t want to raise red flags in Venice, and there is no other significant reason for him to want cybersecurity as a priority. He knows his wife is dead, so it wouldn’t even be to find her. He chose Davina for a reason, and I think it’s because he knows her background and who she is. (1)"
"the tension is building, the ship is building, i love them. i love how sincerely he looks at her, although he snaps at her you can see the softness in his look toward her (like when she says she didn’t mean to)"
"How much do you want to bet Mikey was eavesdropping on their conversation through the door? Also I'm nearly positive that Davina can't leave now. She is in too deep, no matter how you look at it. She is a liability if she leaves and liabilities get offed."
"i am going to say gabe is being unfair here. she specifically asked him if there was anything she needed to know cyber security-related in regards to mikeys safety. NOT telling her about the monitoring was a big mistake on his part. he knew she would want to make improvements to their cyber security that his uncle wouldnt approve of, and still gave her access with no warning. this is entirely on him"
Mikey bragging that Davina was his nanny was so cute 🥰
OMG SUCH A GOOD CHAPTER!!!  My favorite Webtoon!!  The waiting is killing me for the next chapter!  AMAZING job author!!!
Can’t they release episodes twice a week? Pleaseeeeee Having to wait whole 7 days is taking a toll on me😭
He wants our girl to stayyy
omfg how did we go from hot moment to impending death
guys we almost got a kiss 🙉
Deja vu for Davina…😭😰 Poor Mikey and his duck…! Gabriel please be alive!!! 🙏🥺
HE BLUSHEDDDDD
the duck got cooked unfortunately 🥲
"I think she’s surprised him, but he’s fallen for her because of how much she cares about Mikey. If he doesn’t trust anyone - her civil disobedience towards him for the benefit of Mikey is like catnip for his heart. He can rely on her to prioritize Mikey unlike all the others who want to leverage Mikey’s life/future. I really hope he gets out safe. If he’s injured I could see his family trying to use that as an excuse to take Mikey away"
giggling n kicking my feet
"What a ""hot"" episode 😳-->🔥🚒"
Davina was worried about both Mikey and Gabriel’s safety when she noticed the house burning😭😭
Gabriel better have that duck.
Gabriel’s hand on Davina’s cheek 😳
Who else had to scroll back up and look at the almost kiss scene again before leaving ✋🏻
which is more criminal? the angelini mafia or this cliffhanger? 🤨😩
NO I CANT WAIT ANOTHER WEEK
"Romance aside, this has been the chapter to bring it all in. I’m rooting for Davina"
"She wasn’t kidding when she compared Mikey to herself as a kid. He’s breaking down before her eyes from the same trauma. Hopefully Gabriel coming back can help heal things, but I don’t think that kid is ever going to be the same. Especially when he learns that it’s likely intentional (I mean, no way it’s not with the whole family being there tonight)."
ALSO!??!? He was looking at her lips. Omg… also not Davina thinking of Gabriel before Mikey… girlllll🫢
i love how even Gabrielle was caught off guard in that moment. these two have always had their guards up around each other. and here they were both being vulnerable with each other for fhe first time and the intimacy of the scene csught them both by surprise. i love the panel of gabriel just standing in the hallway blushing like he literally doesnt know how to compute what happened
WE NEED A POV FROM GABRIEL
GABRIEL BLUSHING 🗣️📣‼️⁉️🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🙌🏻🙌🏻💯
"Her nightmares come true. But thus time, she has to be the one to save the kid."
This is the webtoon its hardest for me to wait for every week
guys ofc gabriel’s alive he has main character plot armor
Davina realized that she not only has to protect Mikey from danger but his papa as well.
Homegirl's really out here doing it all in bare feet 👏👏👏 Also WOOF that reunion got me right in all my feelings. 😭
"[sobs (clutches at heart)] Thank goodness Gabriel’s alive!!! 😭❤️ The reunion with him and Mikey was so beautiful!!!🥹🥹🥹 Too bad about the duck, though…🐣🦆🪦"
The look of relief on Gabriel’s face when she said next time she’d keep better communication during an emergency. I know he’s happy bc it means she’s staying but I’m like hopefully there won’t have to be a next time! I guess it’s normal for that line of work tho…
Sooo is no one gonna comment on the fact that Gabriel probably got that head wound cause he was worried about Davina and Mikey being stuck in the fire to the point he was practically crazy trying to get back inside the burning building? No? Just me? Ok then 👀✌️
"(1) EVERYONE’s OKAY!!! (2) SHE’S STAYING!! (3) LOOK HOW BADASS SHE LOOKS RIPPING HER DRESS! But seriously, that cousin is a freaking creep. I love Nico protecting his boss in the best way he knows how. Telling Davina to get out of the way if she’s not in is a good call. But girl. You just learned you being nosy got people killed. Now you’re looking through his safe after a fire? Are you sure that’s wise?  Edit: got Nico and Val’s name confused lol more"
"I love the panel where Nico and Davina were startled by the head maiden. These two just give me older and younger siblings vibes 😂... For the most part, glad Gabriel is alright and reunited with little Mikey 🥺💜"
NOT BRO WORRYING ABT HER NOT HAVING HER PHONE ON HER WHEN BRO HAD PRETTY MUCH BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA TO THE HEAD
"RIP Agent Ducky, who perished in the line of duty 😭"
"I swear after seeing Nico and Davina’s twin reaction to the cook, I am CONVINCED they are related. Even their facial expressions look the same. Our orphaned nanny may not be completely without family after all…"
we NEED a Gabriel pov of the fire situation! I’m obsessed!!
Raise a glass for our fallen brother … there will be no waddling away from this one 😔
IM SO FREAKING INVESTED IN THIS SERIES
"that panel where all the outsiders are blurred by smoke and only Gabe,  Vina and Mikey are in the inner circle? *chef's kiss* 🤌🏿 the glint in his eyes when he realized she was staying melted me.  I also love the way Davina reassured Mikey even while being concerned herself. She is COMMITTED!!! I love the implications of this."
"Watch me not be at all shocked when Davina presents Mikey with an exact, hand-stitched replica of his duck she whipped up in her “spare time” 🤣"
The way she tied her hair by tearing up dress she was looking so damnnn hott😻❤️
"Call me crazy, but I like Cassiel. I’m hopeful he’ll be a big ally to Davina."
"Like Father like Son, both try running into burning buildings for each other 💀💀"
"Rip ducky, you will not be forgotten 😭"
I’m ready for some sibling energy between Davina and Nico 🤩
We needed Gabriel's reaction of Davina ripping her dress that savagely. I mean THAT WAS HOT
Mikey’s face when he was defending his dad’s hair color 😂🫶
cue the accidental bathroom and towel scene. 📣
"Oh hell nah, that olive munching bastard better leave our girl the hell ALONE!"
Wait… IS THERE GOING TO BE ONLY ONE BED TOO?!?! Please pleaseee pleaseeee i love that trope sometimes ahhhhhhhhhh.
“Welcome home” 😳😳
MIKEY HOLDING ONTO HIS LEG IS TOO CUTE IM OBSESSED
Gabriel sure enjoys teasing Davina…
Ducky served Mikey well as his loyal right hand man. His sacrifice will never be forgotten 🫡
"I swear, Gabriel is flirty on purpose!!! Davina won't survive this! It’s just the start and he smirked two times already. 😏😏😏"
I need another 10 eps to drop neoowwwwweee 😭
"""and they were room mates."" ""my God, they were roommates."""
HAHAHAH I LOVE THIS TROPE. I’ve never said this before but why does Gabriel have such a snatched waist
"I wanna know if Davina was friends with Nico, Val, and Gabriel when she was younger and just doesn’t remember it…and if so I NEED pics of all the young versions of the characters together!!!"
“Right after I sleep 10 hours” Adam is me fr
"i love that gabriel is GENUINELY  a good father. the house has burnt down, there are SO MANY THINGS to prioritize and get sorted. but he still takes a moment to get down and console mikey about losing his favorite toy"
"gabriel is such a good father to mikey, i love them so so much. he cares for him beyond comprehension"
"the uncle burning down his nephews house, amd him being most likely the one that personally called the hit on her parents. man loves his fires like he loves his olives damn"
"genuine props to the creator of this series, if youre not the author you can look past this but im in shock ive never read such a good series with such a good plot and well written characters I LOVE THIS SERIES SMMMM"
I think he fell first 🤣
i love davina and adams dynamic. he always make a point to look out for her and be friendly
Gabriel is literally the size of a door... both width and hight! 😲😲😲
"Gabriel is always flaunting his physique at her… not that I’m complaining, just being observant 😁"
Mikey holding onto Gabriel’s leg! That boy has no right to be so cute and that man has no right to be so fine 🥰🥰🥰
Davina gets told that her curiosity costs lives. Proceeds trying to open a safe.
Davina and Mikey’s dynamic is so cute 🥹❤️
You mean it’s abs day Nico. It’s ABS DAY
My money is burning with these coins I’m buying but I will do anything to see Gabriel’s face 🫡
Mikey accepting the duck from Louis professionally even though we know it meant so much to him 🥹
the thought of Gabriel getting jealous of Nico would send me
Wait.. where are the knives🤨
First off the way he’s touching her damn leg 😤😤
Davina and Gabriel’s relationship seems that it will eventually progress into more than just their current agreement 😳
"1. I live for Mickey and Davina, they unintentionally turned out to be each other's emotional support and I can't wait to see their future interactions 🥰  2. Sir- you can't do this to me at 3AM-"
POOL DAY SPECIAL EDITION NICO
"I have just one question was she or was she not wearing panties in the bandaging scene 🤔🤔🤔🤔 Because if she wasn't, Gabriel got to see a whole lot more than scruffed up legs 😩😩😩 Also Louis giving Mikey the rubber duck was so precious it's ingrained in my brain 🥹🥹🥹❤️❤️"
Mikey putting on the shoes IM DEAD
emotionally vulnerable gabriel being comforted by davina is so :( you can tell he doesn't really have anyone who offers him soft and genuine reassurance that isn't layered with some sort of influence from his uncle or from his position but davina is more willing to be blunt with him and I think he needs that badly ☹️
It seems like Mikey and Louis will eventually became two inseparable pookies 🥺💕✨🩷
I freaking love that they didn’t just make Mikey cool with losing everything. Him struggling with losing his wardrobe and little things like his rubber duck adds so much to the story. And I love the little look of surprise on Gabriel’s face when Davina told him about her house fire. Part of me wasn’t sure if he already knew.
"Mikey being AFFRONTED at the indignity of being seen in these clothes, only to put his shoes on in the MOST undignified way, is just peak kid logic i love it so much"
I'M DYING. WE WERE FED SO WELL THIS NIGHT
"as much as we were all joking last chapter about there being only one bed, i srsly APPRECIATE the fact that Gabriel gave her a key to lock her own room for privacey. its a commen romantic trope so i get it, but in reality suddenly being forced into sleeping arrangements with a man at night can be uncomfortable, even if u trust that man or are interested in him. Gabriel respects her privacey and her comfort and i love that"
The way he held her leg and made sure she was appreciated over the fact she saved mikey has my heart 🫣😓
Grey sweatpants and shirtless?? I SEE YOUR GIFT AND BLESS UR SOUL 🫠🤤
"love Gabriel taking care of her and being vulnerable. not as her boss or as a love interest, but as a Father who almost lost his son just hours ago, and is still reeling from the fact that all the what ifs around davina could have been the difference between mikey sleeping in the bedroom next to him or not tonight. what a terrifying reality. and then Davina opening up to him about her own trauma, and making it clear that she cares about Mikey personally and wouldve saved him even if she had quit"
love louis wearing an outfit so close to the one mikey hated XD
i’m calling it nico is 2nd male lead
NO BUT I ACTUALLY LIKE MIKEYS NEW FRIEND 😭😭
"not all mafia nannies are created equal, y'know."
"""Play stupid games, win stupid prizes""."
i’m glad that davina caught on in time but that was such a rookie mistake to be so trusting with a stranger. especially when they literally just escaped a fire the previous night.
"ARE YOU KIDDING ME. Please tell me Louis doesn’t know anything, Mikey needs a friend 😭😭 Or if he does, that he sympathizes with Mikey and is genuine with their friendship… 🥲"
I hope Louis ain’t in on it. I ain’t ever seen Mikey so happy!
Davina’s duality from intense bodyguard to lovable nanny is insane!
Nico where you hiding those knives during pool day? 🤨
I'm so surprised they didn't do thorough background checks into the family and the nanny before allowing a playdate but I love watching this play out
"Two households, both alike in dignity, In fair Verona, where we lay our scene adhagshwbdhwb"
Either Louis doesn’t know anything and is a sweet little friend for Mikey or he’s pretending and is also a little baby mafia just like Mikey. Either way they need to be best friends
star crossed friendship between these boys truly
I really like Davina and Nico’s dynamic! we love a redhead duo ❤️
Not Mikey becoming friends with the only mob boss kid in his class 😭
"Get in, loser. It’s pool day."
There’s only room for one mafia nanny in this webtoon
I think she's an overprotective mother just like a certain father...
"i dont think Davina niavely gave the nanny the key. i think it was on purpose. the fact that nico was right there, and also saw that interaction and didnt speak up mskes me think it was planned. and when he walks into the room he says ""you were right"". it mightve been the case they didnt have any evidence she was sus, so they gave her an opportunity to prover her innocence or guilt"
pls let Mickey have more pool days with Louis 🥺🥺🥺
Not me staying up till 4am just to see what pool day has in store for us. Am I dump? Yup. Do i regret it? Never😌
Busted almost immediately. Don’t send your incredibly unsubtle nanny to bug a mafia boss’s son! I hope Mikey and Louis can somehow still stay friends
I hope the boys can still be friends. It would be so cute for the two future mob bosses to be childhood besties.
I knew it was an inside job! The Don seemed pleased about it but at the same time he could’ve gotten hurt so who could it be? 🧐🤨
I LITERALLY FELL TO THE FLOOR WHEN HE SAID HE WAS TEASING HER IM BEING CALLED A TWEAKER WHEN IM JUST BEING REAL!!!
DID 👏🏻 HE 👏🏻 STUTTER 👏🏻
patiently waiting for them to get together
DID HE STUTTER NO  *cutely eats her macaroni*
"Took me a second read to realize Mikey ended up eating the macaroni, and happily 😂"
The way she subtly pushed the macaroni towards him and then he abandoned his steak for it 😂 😭 she knows Mikey so well.
This means that Mikey and Louis are unknowingly sworn enemies because their parents are rivals 😭😭
Was Gabriel’s joke a bad attempt at flirting?!…
"both chapters davina has tucked mikey into bed has been so soft and motherly. and her brushing his hair as she tucks him in. and the way mikey actually acts like a little kid being tucked in and doesnt have his normal ""grown up"" front up. it melts me heart everytime."
My coins are reserved for this and this only.
So he cornered her into confessing about the fire from her childhood but then felt guilty after he saw how talking about it affected her? He knows more than he’s letting on.
"OK loving the way this plot moves along where each side gets a little more information about the other as the story progresses. I'm totally looking forward to seeing what Gabriel will do with what he learns about Davina, and what Davina will uncover next!"
"They already be acting like a mom and dad, now it just needs to become official 😏"
Mikey drawing a little duck after he wanted an adult sized meal is so funny for some reason
Actual footage of Mikey being tucked in to bed by Davina:
"This really is the best webtoon I’ve ever read, I wish it were all out already so I could devour it 😭"
He can tease!! 🤭🤭🤭
who else thinks the duck is bugged? 😐
"He was gonna apologize 🥹😭 I don’t know that he has any malicious intent with her—if anything at all, he probably knew some things about her and knows she isn’t just there as a nanny, but I don’t think he’s intentionally manipulating her or using Mikey against her."
EVERYONE. ITS CONFIRMED. MIKEY IS A TRUE ARTIST 🥺🥺 that duck drawing was the new van gough
When she was trembling Gabriel looked worried😭😭
Aye yo waitttt did yall peep how he was tryna clear up when he asked about the fire she lived through at dinner??? And his face when she said she lost everything??? 🥺 they’re gonna be so good together just wait omg
Gabriel's smirk is just AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!😍
Gabriel and Davina’s proximity to each other 😭😭
Absolutely every one of my coins goes to this webtoon 🔥🔥
"Fr had flashbacks to their little ✨️chat✨️ before the Mansion burned down, ah yes, memories.  Also Mr.Bunny man better not fuccing 🐓block my girl again, the audacity   Anyone else also a lil suspicious of Mikey's new duck? It was checked for listening devices but idk, seems like too good of a hiding place. more"
"Gabriel is sending so many mixed messages. Take my son away from this life, but first I’m gonna pull you into my schemes against the French…"
"Davina is (legimately) building up walls between them but dear, oh dear, do I want Gabriel to tear them down ASAP 😩... And Gabriel, SIR, stop making us drool with each panel..."
Gabriel and Davina having a stare off and Val is just like “so what the play?” 💅
ok but the fact that Gabriel trust Davina enough to essentially take mikey away from him is such a big deal
I find this so interesting because at this point I’m convinced Gabriel knows her background. Maybe it’s why he thinks Davina can help Mikey be free because she is? Still it doesn’t help she’s becoming involuntarily involved in his mafia plans lol
Hopefully the second angle isn’t using Louis 😞🙏
lol Davina knowing exactly how to lose mikeys interest 🤣🤣
“i want my son to be free” OMG AHJDJCBCJCKC 😭😭 gabe will literally do anything for his boy
I think Gabriel might still have a chance at being saved despite what Davina might think right now ☹️ he may need a nudge and a push in the right direction or even just someone to tell him that it's not too late bc he seems to think it's too late for himself too ☹️
BYE the way they get so close to each other and don't even realize it 😭😭😭
"Good choice Mikey, run away from maths"
Micky holding Nico’s hand 🥹
Mikey wanting a second art apron for Louis is so pure 😭💕😂
The way they’re opposites concerning literally anything but Mikey. He’s their Achilles heel 😭 and they’ll cover for each others weaknesses because of him. It’s tragic. Give me more 😮‍💨
Davina and Gabriel are quarrelling like a married couple already ☺️💖✨
Like what i said last chapter.. Two steps forward... Ten steps back!
I don't see where the love would possibly come in he's just using her lol 😂 and he'll just keep making it harder and harder to protect Mikey
I vote Mikey becoming a famous painter in his new path ✨
she wanted to reach out to him!!! That man absolutely needs your protection. They need you to save them both. I think she was beginning to see how much he's reluctantly apart of this life. The meeting kind of upends that but it's still true. He doesn't want to be here either. I wonder what Val makes of this. She already thinks there's something strange about Davina. Will this make her dig? He's officially talking shop in front of her. It's a new day.
"I genuinely think that Val is a double agent of some sort. Her entire thing is not trusting Davina and she won’t let Gabriel do his job with Davina without trying to make some sort of point that Davina isn’t who she says she is. I may be way off, but her suspicion is starting to look like interrogation on behalf of another source."
"“Money money money, must be funny in a rich man’s world” 🕺🕺🕺 (if your money is running out sing along)"
Gabriel and Davina are now partners in crime!
"Okay honestly, Val has good instincts. Davina DID initially go there to uncover the truth about her past… but I’m hoping if things do blow up like they eventually do that this doesn’t compromise her relationship with Mikey, she really does care for him :("
We really need an ex wife back story
If val finds out about davinas past and tells Gabriel and he’s like “I already know” I WILL FREAK TF OUT
"It's interesting that Davina's fake surname is Bonetti(good), and her real surname is Diavolo(literally means ""devil)"
She's protecting Mikey. That's all you need to know. 🤷‍♀️
I'm betting right now that two of them were friends during their childhood!
"Just watch, Davina and Val are gonna be besties in the future🧸"
will never get enough of gabriel teasing davina omg 😭🩷
"Gabriel’s plan may be to somehow ruin the Don's empire, so he and Mikey can be free. Davina is here in case his plan doesn't work in full, because he's treading on dangerous ground with what he's doing and may end up being punished by his uncle. Davina should save Mikey and run in case that happens."
"The wife’s panel was so ambiguous. She could be covered in blood as a victim — or a perpetrator. Honestly, the cold, harrowing look in her eyes feels more like the latter."
I just need some Gabe and Davina alone time 🙏
"Oh I really really hope that real trust is established between Nico, Val and Davina. There’s a friendship under all that mafia stuff. A trust network like that would be unstoppable!!"
I'm glad to know Nico and Val aren't blindly loyal and can see this is stupid on Gabriel's part. Nico can see a shadow of what Gabe is up to. I have no problem with Val having her suspicions because she's not wrong. Davina has an ulterior motive. It's not nefarious but she does have something else she's after. I think picking up on that is good. But I wonder how she'll react when she realizes the name is a plant and a dead end.
If Val turns out to be evil I’m gonna cry
"won't it be so funny when Val goes through all this effort to prove that Davina is the heir to the diavolo line, dramatically reveals her secret, and Gabriel goes lol yeah why do you think I hired her dummy"
"Davina: “Idk, I just work here”"
All my money and coins go to this 😂 it is my fav series!!!
The look that Gabriel gives Davina 😩
"I completely get the suspicion, Davina isn’t careful at all when she is snooping. They’re all on her radar already and even now she doesn’t care to be careful and not act suspicious, they have no reason to trust her tbh."
i always wish the episodes were a little bit longer each time!
"""No family to ask questions, or to miss her if-"" I believe sir at one point you will be eating those words."
I appreciate the author taking the time to make clear exactly why Gabriel hired Davina. speculating is fun but also can be frustrating if in the end it really didn't matter
“no one to miss her if she dies” bestie don’t YOU think you’d miss her 👀
I think Gabriel knows exactly who she is.
"If Val gets her in trouble with the wizard weirdo, after being told to trust her, I fear Val may not be with us to the end of the story. 😬  edit: there's a lot of interesting commentary in these replies. just to clarify, my comment wasn't targeted at hating Val bc ""she's interfering in my ship"" or bc ""she gives pick me vibes."" it was directed to Val purposely ignoring her bosses orders to trust Davina and the plot heavily implying that Gabriel knows more about her than he's letting on.  more"
"""Especially because I can't tell you about everything""  Does he know Davina's origin story??"
I have this feeling at some point Gabriel is going to have to ask Davina to take Mikey and disappear.
Um miss headmistress of ENA would sure as hell miss Davina and sure as hell seek some sweet sweet revenge if Davina were to ‘disappear’
Mikey seems to be denying how he really feels about his mother’s death by hiding behind his desire to be like his papa and therefore wanting to eventually become a mafia boss like his papa without fully understanding the consequences😭
"Val I completely get your suspicion, but you cannot possibly be sure. Jumping the gun like that just because you’re mad you got told no makes you a liability.￼￼   Edit: to the person who wrote a racist reply to this about Val, you’re unwelcome. Not acceptable (I see your edit to remove the details about her race, thanks)"
My theory: it’s Nico. He’s certain it’s not her but wants her background so he can handle her. He’s come from some other part of the family and it makes sense that it’s him or Val.
the wizard has drip ngl
Hmmm...Nico is...interesting to challenge his partner Val and cause a ruckus over Davina. So interesting that he'd even convince his partner to reach out to the Don's people. Why is Val doing all this work?
Mikey: face of a toddler. Brain of a chocolatier  Edit: Damn I never got this much like ty!
wouldn't it make sense that the person with the cyber security background/hacker be able to scrub all evidence of herself from everything?
"After the fire, it's just normal for anybody to be suspicious of the new people. So whatever anyone says, it just means that Val is loyal to Gabe.  Nico is sus. Why ask Val to use other people to check in on Davina the roundabout way. . When it's discovered that somebody put a hit on Davina, it will be blamed on Val not him."
Nico! ugh i feel so betrayed
"Val honey yeah hi, a couple of words please like back offf"
"I suspect that Gabriel knows who Davina's parent were because, maybe, just speculating he knew her before the fire. like, come on they were waring mafias. In any sort of war you do your research, you know your targets inside out. You know their strengths, their weaknesses and their child. And if Gabriel is as smart as I think he is, even if he forgot her face he would fit the timeframes together and link them to her. Mabey I'm wrong but logically thinking he probably already knows everything. 🤔"
"Hmm..Mikey’s mom almost seemed a bit…..unsmart with how she went about trying to leave this life. I understand her opinion, but to shout that publicly in front of the uncle and other mafia members at a party? If anything, now I’d like to know 1. How did she get mixed up in the underworld and become Gabriel’s wife if she hated it so much? 2. Instead of expressing her opinion and complaining (likely increasing her risk of being killed), did she ever try to get Mikey out privately?"
Tap to see spoiler  View
"I know it’s a small detail in comparison, but it would’ve been better if Mikey’s age was 7+ because ain’t no way a 4 year old is declaring he will be the next underboss 😭"
I miss the Adam the driver haha he was always nice to Davina
"He knew what he was doing there at the end. Also, I love Mikey's new art hobby, little Michelangelo"
I need copius amounts of fanfiction for this like... yesterday
as soon as i saw the thumbnail i just had clicked on it without hesitation
ooooh boy you can't just be touching her like that and expect us all to be calm.
"Okay honestly at this point, I feel like Gabriel is manipulating Davina. I feel like his going to feel sorry about toying with her when it’s to late"
"""this lighting is awful"" ""i'll inform the weathermen"" & ""he painted a wonderful watercolor sky"" ""THESE ARE ACRYLICS"" 😭😭😭😭 i love their dynamic LMAOOOO THEY'RE SO SILLY"
"I normally would have been all aboard that last few panels but Gabriel, what was THAT bro 😭 He’s said please like that last time they touched too but this one felt forced. Either he really does want to be with her or he’s being lowkey manipulative."
Gabriel looking at the ducks 🪿 thinking about Mikey 🥺
Am I the only one who feels like Gabriel’s “touch” felt waaaay too manipulative this time??? Like it felt straight up like he just wanted her to say yes
Is he into her or just using her emotions to manipulate her? Feels like he gets flirty / tactile when he wants her to agree to something...hmm
OKAY BUT GABRIEL SAYING HE NEVER LOOSES SIGHT OF THE END GOAL AND THEN IT SHOWING THE LITTLE DUCKS- HE LOVES HIS SON SO MUCH. WAAAAAHHHH I AM NOT OKAY
Augh that little chin lift at the end. Don’t blame her being swept away! 🤩
I can't wait to see this dress!!!
"great job with the imagery. The ducks when Gabe is telling his uncle that he hasn't lost sight of the end game, which we know is a free Mikey...🤌🏿 *chef's kiss* I also appreciate that through their entire knowing of each other Gabe has always used physical closeness and his sexual energy to get his way, but only these last few times is he now being affected himself and I LIVE!"
ILLEGAL HOT CLIFFHANGER 🥵
"Yeah, he's smirking, but his cheeks were flushed, too, ever so slightly. 😉🤭"
Sir you flirt. He knew exactly what he was doing. Davina’s freaking melting 😂
Adam’s sunglasses
"it pains me to say it, but lately, the vibe with gabriel is... not good"
“May I speak to you?” “Always” 🤭
I love the store guy’s energy😆
oh come ooooonnnnn Davina don't fall for that crap... though he is sinfully handsome
This was a desperate attempt at a date. We see right through you. He is struggling between carrying out a plan that uses her to his benefit and pretending his sexual energy is just fun for him and he is not actually finding her attractive. You failing on both fronts.
davina is EATING that dress up
"Respectfully, our power couple is looking fierce! Also, I love Mikey parenting his dad. I wonder if he's going to be sitting in the recliner waiting for the kids to get home"
gabriel in glasses 🥵🥵
"I love that Davina snooping around has real consequences. She didn’t think through the risks of poking around the servers or of trying to open the safe. And now, she’s suspected by all the people who matter. Hopefully she figures out soon that no risk is free."
"Ohh, Davina you're getting sloppy at sleuthing. Even Gabriel caught you safe sleuthing this time."
everyone shut up they held hands.
DAVINA IS SO DAMN HOT and btw Val is freaking pissing me off idk
Hot damn those two look like a power couple and even Mikey has grudging approval 🤭
THE SWEAT ON HIS NECK WHEN SHE SAYS ILL BE PROTECTING YOU
that towel is the most dangerous thing in this story.
"Gabriel: “… it reminds me of math.” Me with my math degree bouncing up and down with excitement: “THATS BECAUSE IT IS MATH. Specifically almost a K6 graph from graph theory, but one edge is missing on the bottom and one pair of vertices have two edges connecting them.” 😃"
I’m sorry but Mikey Nico and Adam playing video games together is just too cute
"Not gonna lie, glasses can be the sluttiest thing a man can wear 😮‍💨"
mother and father are slayinggg the outfits ✨
when will davina learn to stop looking at things she shouldn't in places where her employers are around. like at least wait until you're alone for a few hours to avoid suspicion  😭😭
OMGG THEYRE MATCHING 😭❤️
OKAY JESSICA RABBIT MAFIA MOMMY 🥵
"I notice Davina is starting to flirt back, although I wonder if she realizes that that's what she's doing?  😏😉"
"ok while im glad that the uncles hacker now believes Gabriels innocence at trying to snoop in their system im getting VERY nervous at how guilty this is making Davina. im also worried that this repeated attention to her necklace, the one connection to her past life, and the crimes her parents commited"
It’s giving Mob wife
The color coordination in their outfits is ✨sending me into the stratosphere✨ in the best way possible 😮‍💨
GUYS HES BLUSHING
Mikey seems to be on to his papa and his nanny…
petition for more silly davina faces i can’t take this
*dies from not being able to wait for another damn episode* 🪦😬🫨
I don’t care who has a “bigger bust” Davina is way better
Gabriel calling Davina “One of a kind”. 😭😭
the way Gabriel keeps checking Davina in every panel.. 🥺
the guys got one thing right: she is a DISTRACTING consort 😳😳
WHOOP WHOOP ITS THE SOUND OF DA POLICE
A day on Monday night: *ding* *rises from the dead and reads the webtoon* *clifhanger* *dies again*
I’m so ready for this development in Davina. It’s going to be rough but she needs it to live for the future instead of being stuck in the past. I love where her character development is headed ☺️
"she was going to tell him, she was going to tell him !!"
I’m gonna need some more physical contact asap
snake in the henhouse vibes. someone snitched
Oh Cassiel charming as ever to leave right when things are about to go down 😂
lowkey wish i discovered this webtoon when it was further along cause im going into debt over here
"me personally, I love how he went thru all of this to get Louie and Mikey together as friends again"
"lol no matter the Granny, they WILL try to set you up with their grandkids"
Dang wish we coulda gotten more on that balcony but whatever slow burn it is
Why is no one mentioning the obnoxiously small champagne glasses???
"i do enjoy gabriel and davina talking at the end, him opening up about his childhood. i also like how davina covers her curiousity by saying she wants to know the difference compared to Mikey (which is tru). but her more honest motivation is to compare her childhood with his"
"Im a big fan of Brexio,,, too many hot men in this comic"
Ugh they're so worth my money ❤️🤭
"uh oh, I've fallen into the fast pass hole and I cannot escape 😭"
"So...who snitched? My guess is Cassiel. He seems to be the type to stir up stuff just to watch the chaos ensue. It could be the new guy for the same reason, but I highly doubt it."
"I just have a feeling mama recognized Davina immediately, or had an instant inkling of who she is."
"""That's not how I saw this night going."" Neither did we Gabriel  😭 neither did we"
“isn’t where i saw the night going” mmmmmkay 👀
"Why do I have a bad feeling that Gabriel's first ""exposure"" was burning down Davina's house?"
I think Gabriel’s mom recognized her…
so the hotness runs in the fam? mkay
awwe poor Mikey losing his best friend playdates now....
"I kinda wondered if Val had something to do with the police coming, glad to see it wasn't her. Now I'm wondering if it was our main man's cousin. He was the only other one from the family there"
Val this is so not girlie pop of you
HEIGHT DIFFERENCE 🙊⁉️
Anyone ever notice that Mikey lowkey looks kinda like boss baby lol
"To be honest, I kinda like how val is going above and beyond to look into davinas past. She smelt something suspicious and is doing her job."
I wonder how Gabriel saw the night going…
idc abt war rn he gave her his jacket.
"I mean, Davina running in those heels!! omg 👌🏻👌🏻"
"I'm not the only one who wanted Gabriel and Davina to hide their faces by pretending to be an amorous couple and kissing each other senseless, right??? For ""the mission"" or whatever.... (I know this makes no sense but a girl can dream)"
Gabriel’s body proportions r a bit crazy lmao Edit: don’t get me wrong tho I love a man with a slvtty little waist
Maybe Gabriel’s mom was friends with Davina’s parents 🤔 something tells me perhaps Davina’s parents didn’t die in that fire but they new she was better off out of the mafia life
👀Mom knows - or strongly suspects she knows - who Davina is
"Gabriel is used to being the protector.  It must be reassuring to see Davina protect him, even whilst knowing who he is and what he represents (but doesn't want)."
I think she knew Davina but also knew the backstory and did not want Valentine to know. Valentine gives me loyalty to the uncle vibes and like she thinks she knows better
gabriel is so pookie bear snookum cakes 🙈😍
"Wait….hear me out….its a long shot, but…what if Gabe knew her as a child, recognized her…and hired her knowing who she is. He has a very interesting level of trust with her. Also i think the mama knows, which would explain my theory. 😳🫣 I love this WEBTOON."
can’t believe he missed davina’s lips smh
"A KISS ON THE HAND, WE WINNNNNNN YAYYY"
WHAAAAAA?!? OMG- JUST CONFESS ALREADY!!!!! GABRIEL YOU BETTER LIVE SIR!!! LIVE!!!!!😭
"I know we’re all a little hot and bothered over that hand kiss, but are we gonna ignore how badass Davina was for “I’ll take care of MY Angelini”…she’s already claimed Mikey as hers 🥹"
“Don’t make me beg Davina” AND THOSE EYES?:?/!/?/!-! EYES DON’T LIE
"Whether or not she realizes it, Davina wanting Gabriel to survive, rooting for him, is very reassuring. That's probably why he reacted that way, because I think nobody has been 100% in his corner for a very long time."
also asking her to keep Mikey if he dies is SUCH a big ask like. i
So Mikey 100% broke out of his room and is going to Louie right? Like you can’t leave the boy that tricky alone for an extended amount of time you’re just asking for trouble
The fact that we are all kicking our feet in the air after that hand kiss.. god I love us hopeless romantics
I have a feeling Mikey is going to run away and go look for Louis and talk to his mother.
Love the SpongeBob two hours later panel haha
Mikey is NOT in his room.
Gabriel and Davina’s chemistry is on fire!! This will definitely lead to a kiss!! 💋❤️‍🔥
I love how she goes “we will be waiting”
“See you at home” 😭 they’re such a lil family already
"i gotta say i REALLY like Val, because shes RIGHT davina IS hiding something and she does has ulterior motives. but shes also not ruled by emotions and is rational in knowing that Davina will keep mikey safe if nothing else. and because that is gabriels number 1 concern val doesnt push the issue"
"Notice how when he looks at Davina his eyes go clear, like she clears his conscious & makes him see the future clearly 🥹🥰 Also, the hand kiss is very wonderful & I hope it’s just a taste of the sweetness to come. I hope they both make it or eventually, Mikey in hand."
Not me giggling and kicking my feet 💀😮‍💨
THESE BREADCRUMBS ARE ALL THAT SUSTAIN ME
"Reply 1 311 1 Rebecca Mayerchak Jun 18, 2024 HE KISSED HER HAND"
what if Gabriel was the one to call the police so there would be a war and him and Mikey could get a distance from each other that's why on episode 31 he told val that he picked her because she had no family to ask questions. HE PLANNED THE ENTIRE THING I have a feeling he might not tell her to come back and try to get the don down and  ends all the mafia stuff.
"Brb, gonna read that final scene like five more times—gotta get my coins worth"
"""You're as scary as Papa."" See!! they're already so alike!!!  Also, I love the ominous cousin guy, definitely not evil. nope no way"
The cousin gives me bad vibes
Hey Gabriel’s hot cousin stay back alr 🤺
I really appreciate the author for not just focusing on the romance aspect of the comic. This being such a major plot line and the way it's forming is really engaging and adding to the suspense of the characters and story
"That was mad suspicious, cousin"
mikey’s first appearance without his suit?!
"The cousin seems sus trying to figure out where Mikey is! Also, love that Mikey thinks Gabriel and Davina are equally scary 😂 and don’t get me started on his “peasant gear”!"
I AM DESPERATE FOR FLIRTING 😭 Edit: I know plot is important BUT ITS GETTING IN THE WAY
Gabriel looks like if Satoru Gojo was buff and also Italian
so the cousin definitely was the one who called the cops
Omg claw brigade instead of paw patrol haha
"Oh my good gosh I just reread the chapter and noticed the stained glass panel...both Gabriel's deceased father and wife have cracks where the living people don't, but there is a crack travelling towards Mikey. I might be reading too far into it, but nooooooo"
Mikey and Davina causally biking to the safe house while Gabriel is “fighting for his life.”
So did the cousin kill the wife?! Why is next week so far away?! 😭
"Davina taking the blame for stealing Mikey in the night was so sweet of her. She could’ve said we’re going because your dad is worried for your safety but instead went with, “I’m taking your safety into my own hands” so that if something happens to Gabriel, Mikey won’t have resentment toward him."
Mikey telling Davina that she is just as scary as his papa. Nanny and papa duo!!
"i have this teeny feeling that the cousin is jealous of Gabriel and Mikey and wants to become the Don/Underboss himself. I feel like he was the one who did the fire, and now he’s acting sus before a literal gun fight. MY INSTINCTS ARE SENSING SOMETHING. I have a feeling Adam/Nico/Val are going to get hurt trying to save Gabriel from his cousin… but it’s just a hunch."
"OMG the fact that Gabriel can’t face his son, when he was leaving the sadness in his eyes 🥹"
When Gabe had said “they’re safe” it shows that he cares a lot for both Mikey and Davina💗😭!
Ngl the author had me in the first couple panels. I thought Davina was a bald kidnapper 😅
Now I have to wait a week why is a week so long 😔😭
so cousin is vying for power?! He's not in the line of succession so he's trying to eliminate that whole branch of the family tree to usurp the title.
"6pm is also when Gabe has dinner with… Davina. I bet Davina will be a target at some point, not the Angelinis. Especially if she’s a mafia princess or the daughter of FBI agents or something."
love the lesson davina taught mikey... he needed to hear it 🥹🥹
Mikey and Davina’s pinky promise 🥹
Mikey’s future step mamma 💅🏼 settling in her pending role
she took such a risk but what a payoff. she got through to him. my heart
"Awe Mikey. Poor little guy. I'm glad Davina is there to help him understand just how much his dad does love him, but man that made me tear up"
"i really do like that davina opened up to mikey because he needed to face reality one day. however, i’m a bit worried that someone will know about davina’s past and will be used against her. guess we’ll have to see what future chapters hold."
MIKEY!!! My heart. The pinky promise! Him getting mad for Davina’s family dying—not realizing it was HIS family who did it! Him sobbing trying to protect his adult father—not realizing it’s not his job and he’s just a kid! My entire heart is shattering for this child. I’m so happy Davina told him. It really got him to open up to her.
I know Mikey’s mom is just so thankful Davina is taking care of her boys😭😭😭😭
"Mikey finally realizing why Davina is taking it upon herself to make sure he gets away from that life. They’re about to get even closer than before, but I fear that will also mean something big is about to happen to Davina. Stay safe girly you gotta get your man first 🥺♥️"
also seeing Mikey act like a child is so refreshing and cute. 🥹🥹🥹🥹
Okay but Gabriel with the dual wields is the hardest panel that’s come out of this webtoon
GABRIELLE HAD  ANGEL WINGS BEHIND HIM!!! THE SMOKE! YAL CATCH THAT
i really something bad doesn't happen to davina and mikey while they're having this heart to heart... 😬😬
Gabriel let her off with a warning shot because he didn't want her kid to be without a mom. Sobbing.
God bless mickey was finally able to speak his true feelings and we saw papa in action aswell 🌚
Davina teaching Mikey what Gabriel so desperately wants him to know - love doesn't have to come with strings tied to the family.
ignore me i‘ll just be ugly sobbing in the corner
"Oh my days…Mikey, you had me when you said🥺… “I think it’s hurting HIM” 😭😭😭 It’s hurting ME too! 🤧🤧🤧 … I’ll be crying myself to sleep now."
Can someone PLEASE adapt this into an anime. It gives me SpyXFamily vibes but more drama-centered and I adore it 😭
"Davina has such a kind, respectful way to share her wishes and feelings with Mikey and make space for his too. This episode is so beautiful."
"im so glad she was able to get mike to truly understand by relating to him. and while i think some ppl might worry about her secret getting out through mikey, i actually think its a GOOD thing mikey knows. so that when the truth comes out mikey can say he already knows."
I have never wanted to jump into a story and hug someone more than I do right now
The way Davina opened up to Mikey just melted my heart! 🥺  the way Mikey was riding that bike though had me cracking up 🤣
“You are the best decision I’ve made in years” ATE THAT UP
YOU HEAR THAT? HE SAID THE THREE OF US 🎉
Damn she actually killed somebody 👁️👄👁️ I already knew Davina doesn’t mess around when it comes to Mikey but she does NOT mess around !
"""JUST THE THREE OF US"""
Gabriel telling Davina that she is the best decision that he has made in years🥹🥹
Oh my goddd so the Angelinis DID take out Davina’s family. This is such a great end to the first part of an amazing series.
MIKEY TUGGING DAVINA IN IS THE CUTEST
Gabe and Mikey crying got me in my feels
"okbut the person on the other line calling Davina ""your families mistake"" sounds like someones figured out who davina really is and that shes a loose end from an Angelini job gone wrong"
“Just the THREE of us” gawd damn that line got me-!!!
Makes me kind of sad that Mikey immediately knew to bring that blanket to try to stop Davina's bleeding...our little boy's seen so much violence 🥺😭
So we ain’t gonna talk about how Davina shot that guy COLD? like ZERO hesitation? Like a casual Monday evening?? No???
davina please be okay😭🙏🏼 also this is the first time i’ve seen gabriel cry. (edit: davinas flexible?!) edit 2: WE HAVE TO WAIT 21 DAYS FOR THE NEXT SEASON?! i edited the next part out. edit 3: also when gabriel asked who shot/tagged davina i knew he was ready to swing hands with someone😭
THANK YOU CREATOR. WE WERE SO WELL FED THIS EPISODE 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Cassiel when I catch you cassiel 😡😡 and omg “just the three of us” 😍😍 okay get married NOW
"I loved the way Mikey and Gabe were so attentive to Davina. Mikey made sure Davina was covered up and kept tugging that cover to ensure her warmth. I think the thing Gabes been waiting to hear from Mikey was, ""Even if I don't become your under boss, even if you don't become the don."" Gabriel has been trying to get his son to detach from this and finally a little breakthrough. I loved this episode, action-packed and beautiful all in one!!!❤️❤️❤️ Vina is a boss!!!"
"""Just the three of us"""
"LOVE THIS!!! 🥹💕💕💕 Okay, I have to know: how big of an age gap do you guys think Gabe and Davina have?? There has to be one! I’m thinking 3-6 years only though. 🤔"
“you’re the best decision i’ve made in years” is his “i love you never leave me” 😭
Gabriel  crying and saying just the three of us IM CRYING  JUST GET MARRIED PLS 😭
I knew this was the end of season one! I can't wait for the next season. Hopefully we'll get to see more of Davina's back story and know more of Mikey's mom. I can't wait to see more GabrielXDavina moments!
so someone is targeting Davina….hmm I wonder who
Hol up- family’s mistake?! Can’t wait for part 2!
I JUST KNOW EVERYONE WAS FIGHTING FOR THIS CHAPTER THE COMMENTS ON THE OTHER ONE WAS LIKE A LIVE CHAT 😭😭
"I love that Diana's handler is so much like a step in mother for her, sincerely worried about her safety and not just for the job"
we waited 3 weeks and an extra 20 minutes for this episode 🥳🎉
Dropping the title card like that is a NASTY STROKE OF GENIUS
MIKEY CALLING DAVINA “VINA”🥹
that panel of them smirking at each other… oh they match each others freak alright
"Davina’s relationship with the dean is too cute😭, “it’ll be there whether you ask for it or not” “your voice softens when you speak about him” I love it, mother and daughter"
You weren’t joking when you said slow burn damn
Did anyone else start cackling uncontrollably when the new episode came out? Or was it just me?
"WHAT A WAY TO KICK OFF THE NEW SEASONNNNNNN The headmistress going Mama Bear over Davina? Adorable. Mikey critiquing the stock photos? On-brand, kiddo.  Davina setting us up for more adventures? <airhorns> LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO <crowd roaring> And Gabriel [did you think I forgot him? Nnaaahhh] being as much of a mystery as ever? 😎 well well, it's enough to keep the fan theories coming!  Also lol the ending made me double take and wonder if it's a D&D reference lol are we rolling for initiative?  more"
GABRIEL KNOWS THAT DAVINAIS QUICK AND CREATIVE SO HE LETS HER HAVE A LITTLE FUN WITH THIS KINDA THING AWH
"""They won't find anything, I buried it deep."" GIRL YOU JUST TOLD MIKEY THO 😭😭"
WHY DOES IT FEEL SO SHORT!!!! BRO NOT ANOTHER WEEK 🥹
"Perfect way to drop that title. And does this means the reigns have been let loose?!?! Please tell me we’ll finally find out what “does she smell like oranges, boss” means! 🍊 Cannot wait to see where this goes!"
Mother Headmistress KNOWS Davina's gotta thing for him. But she also knows that her little soldier child will never let that kid fight alone. that's what is scaring her more than the crush.
Let’s go new episode after 3 weeks of suffering
did y’all see the smirks they gave eachother😭
"waitttt, is it just me or was there a lil blush when she said an ‘invitation to do whatever’????????just sayin✋😌🤚"
LOVE IT when a hiatus isn't 8 months
"That blush when he says ""initiative"". You're not fooling me Gabriel, you heard the conversation.😏"
"Worth the wait, our favorite trio back again!"
HER VOICE SOFTENS WHEN SHE TALKS ABOUT HIM
THE BANTER! AHHHHH these two. love em
"Anyone else just looking forward to more about Mikey? I mean I know that Davina and Gabriel are the focus here, but I’m loving Mikey’s character growth and how he’s really starting to act, well, like a KID. ☺️"
Davina is unable to read all of the signals that Gabriel is sending her😭😭
loid forger think he slick in that wig
i was kinda hoping gabriel would help davina redress her wounds... 🤭🤭
"""He looks at me differently now"" - oh this is THAT kind of a slow burn, I am so into it"
nah cause the skull out of olives is killing me
""" he looks at me differently now"" ""are you sure you're ok after what happened..?""  ""you're the best decision I've made in years "" ""this isn't where I saw the night going"" GODAMN YALL WE'RE SO CLOSE"
Out of topic but has anyone noticed that Gabriel and davinas last name is kind of like devil and angel. Well kind of lol.
"Davina: “I don’t know where i stand with him.”  Also Davina: “He HELD me until the doctors arrived”, “he looks at me differently” (with care)  gurllll…"
Davina sees Gabriel’s feelings for her as distraction 😭😭😭
I JUST REALIZED THE COAT DAVINA IS  WEARING IS GABRIELS😀
WAIT WHY WAS DAVINA BLUSHIN AT VAL🤭
we are living for Gabe's little blushes 🫶  it's a nice touch to let Mikey see the real aftermath of something like this instead of that slowly boiling a frog in a pot crap they pulled with G as he was growing up. seems like this is the first time he's seen all the blood
"""I wouldn't want him to trip at the finish line"" WHO?! WHAT DOES IT MEAN?! Does he want Gabriel to get revenge or does he want to see if Cassiel is actually capable of taking over Gabriel's seat in The Family?! (i.e. making the princes battle to take over the crown type of succession) Also I have a sneaking suspicion that the housekeeper is going to become a more crucial figure in this next arc... time to learn more about the side characters! Seriously love the way the plot is developing!"
Honestly I hope Val and Davina have a great friendship I feel like the two would be badass together
WE LOVE MONDAYS!!!!!! ❤️
"Davina, honey. He kissed your knuckles before the mission. He held you close and said “just the three of us” when you got shot. And u pointed out yourself he looks at you differently. And he’s always blushing around you. It’s pretty obvious 😭"
He was so ready to comfort her omg 😫😫
"I think it’s sweet that Mikey wants to help with cleanup; hopefully, that will make him realize how serious that life is and back away from it! Also, that tension between Gabriel and Davina! You could cut it with a knife!"
I need more of Gabriel caring for Davina 😍
"Gabriel definitely remembering he told her she’s the best decision he made after protecting Mikey and now, he’s getting even more flustered around her."
I’m sorry… GABRIEL IS OVER 6 FEET????
"Google, search for “symptoms of excess olive consumption” 🤔"
at least they both know that sons are off-limits 🫡
"As much as a ship Davina and Gabriele, Mikey’s my favorite thing about this series."
People be like “rip to my coins🙏” BRO RIP TO MY BANK THEY BE CALLING ME SAYING I’m in arranged over draft but I’m here paying for mafia nanny I call that commitment 🫡🫡
I’m happy to see that they both can agree that they want to keep their kids out of the conflict.
mikey getting protective over davina😭😭
Nah I knew that attractive cop was gonna be a problem
"Those two just chillin on a bench eating ice cream. *chef’s kiss* Nice day, casual mob stuff."
Her face paled at the idea she almost got played into doing something she could not undo. That conversation felt so real and the emotions sencere. Looking forward to more team up opportunities.
Imagine Gabriel and Madame Laverne team up. Mickey and Louis will be best buds 😆
I'm like 80% sure Gabriel is the one who shot the plant (with the warning shot to Lavigne). Meaning Mikey just called his dad an idiot and nobody's talking about it
Adam is my favorite character fr😔☝️-
"The cop is cute, not gonna lie. Is he just doing his job to investigate the hotel incident or is he working for a mobster? Only time will tell."
madame lavigne is a girlboss but knows not to cross the line! i hope this means mikey and louis can stay friends 🙏🏼
What a wholesome way to finish out. Two bros enjoying ice cream cones after a successful duck pond mobster meeting. 🧡🍦
Cop is sus y’all I’m with Mikey 🙌🙌🙌
"Much respect for Lavigne and Gabriel.  So many people use their kids to get what they want.  It was refreshing to see them agree that while they may be at odds, their kids are off limits."
I wonder if Gabriel is nervous of the info from Davina because he’s starting to care for her (which obs) and is starting to want the same thing for her as Mikey. To not be a part of the mafia and most certainly may feel guilty for pulling her in
"love mikey being so protective of Davina, and also while still being a brat (he is 4) immediately apologizing and behaving once he saw he hurt davina"
Can I just say I adore Adam
“Who’s dumb enough to shoot a plant?” YOUR FATHER-
"im glad they both have a line they wont cross and Cassial manipulated her into almost crossing hers. i like that she realized she was in the wrong for being duped and wanted to make ammends in the only right way mobsters do: murder. but that what started out as two monsters fighting, turned into 2 parents peace making"
Adam is too goofy 💀💀💀
there’s hope for mikey and louis to be friends 🥺🥺
Hang on a hot second did they almost KISS?!
Gabriel telling Davina that he is captivated by her and almost kissed her😳😳😳
OMG THEY WERE ABOUT TO KISS 😳😳😳
"“Stupid man, you are the payment 💅” Okay ngl Lavigne slayed in that panel"
2ND TIME THEY ALMOST KISSED. maybe 3rd times a charm?? 😭
gabriel shirtless and admitting that he's captivated by her... 🤭🤭
Val might kiss her first if she gets another cookie tbh
“You can call me Gabriel” Me: “Ok daddy—I mean Gabriel”
Wow this was something I Mean they almost kissed and it looks like Val is kinda warming up to Davina do that’s another good thing. Poor Mikey he had a bad nightmare and Davina. :( Overall I loved this episode keep up the amazing work creator!!
GIGGLING KICKING THE AIR THERES NO WAY HE ADMITTED BEING CAPTIVATED BY HER SHIRTLESSSSSSS my man is setting the bar so high AND MIKEY HOW DARE YOU COCKBLOCK 😭 only because you’re absolutely adorable we’ll forgive you
"Mikey making peace cookies for Louis is the cutest blinkin thing ever 😂 but poor lil’ Mikey calling for his mama…  On a separate note, author has really ramped up the romance recently with these episodes goshdaaaang 👀"
love that were not sweeping past the fact that Davina is dealing with the weight of killing 2 people. and while rationally she knows she was 100% right (they were going to kill a child/self defense) shes still grappling with how to feel about it
GAB GOT DISTRACTED BY DAVINA 😱😱😱😱
"Y’all, I swear I’m not psychotic but I kind of want to see what the creepy surgeon doctor lady does to Cassiel. Is that wrong?"
"First of all, thank you for giving the men nipples. I cannot stress enough how severely it irritates my soul when artists give their men gorgeous, Adonis type physiques with painstaking detail and then ""censor"" the nips. Drives me up the wall.  2nd, I'm so glad Gabe said it out of his mouth so she can stop wondering. Girl you got him.  3rd YAY REUNION!! I'm so happy for Mikey and Louis  4thr Cassiel is going to be snapped apart like a lego set and he DESERVES!   Baby we ATE TUHDAY! more"
HOLD UP….. how she make that hot chocolate so fast?? 😧
Gabriel after he ate one of Davina’s homemade cookies:
CAPTIVATED! He's CAPTIVATED!
"I know everyone is swooning about ""I am captivated by you"" and me too because the colors and the softness and Gabe being lickable as always, but the domesticity in this episode had me screaming, crying, throwing up!!!!! Comforting and listening to each other, our little unit watching the sunrise while sipping on hot chocolate, Gabe just absentmindedly distracted at Davina and Mikey making cookies.  😘🤌"
"Mikey saying ""mama"" being the thing that keeps them from making out feels like awful foreshadowing though. I've been harboring a suspicion that the doctor has her and that Gabe was just sent her finger with the ring or something. can't tell if he believes she's really dead or not"
love how Nico and Val fell in love with the cookies
Gabriel comforting Davina after she had a nightmare 🥹
YES THEY GOT CASSIEL THE SNIVELLING LIL WEASEL
YOURE DRIPPING? HELLO? IM SO DIRTY MINDED
Gabriel can’t get enough of Davina‘s cookies 😭
gabriel trying to take the cookies😭
LOLLL NOT THE “Ena preserve me”😭
“You’re dripping” SIR?!??
"I wonder how the whole ""no one leaves"" thing will play out with Davina's one year contract"
"I just want to reiterate my love of this comic, especially for having the female lead wear a modest one piece while the male lead wears a dang Speedo 😂 So refreshing"
mikey’s friendship with louis is so wholesomeeee
it feels like they're a real family 🥹🥹
lol; Davina’s tongue in the panel where Nico calls Gabriel???
Clicked on this so fast . I love this comic sm ❤️  THEY FR NEED TO KISS LIKE WHY NOT??
HALLELUJAH. I've never been so happy to have a filler episode in my life. I need the fluff!!
Gabriel knew she was checking him out and couldn't resist to tease her 🤭🤭🤭
YOURE DRIPPING IS WIIIILD!!!!!!!!!
“You’re dripping” “OMG how did you kno—oh you mean my popsicle…”
SHIRTLESS GABRIEL AGAIN 😍😍
she's so girl boss I love her
Why is this comic so addictive…
"Davina is holding onto the Ena code of ""no feelings"" for dear life"
"Playing with Davina, not demure, not very mindful 😭😭"
I love how all of us are insanely obsessed with this comic and read it almost immediately 😭😭🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾💓💓💓
Wait. Hold up. Have we ever seen Adam with completely clear lenses???? Almost didn’t recognize him without the transition lenses.
SHES DRIPPING GABRIEL? SAY THAT AGAIN FOR ME ONE MORE TIME 👂✋
“sorry your nanny is a lazy cow” HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT DAVINA
I really am so glad Mikey has his friendship with Louis 😭
Bro Gabriel you should have gone with her 😤
“I’m sorry we blew up your hotel” is crazy 😭
“We’ll keep him safe” “I know YOU will” KICKING MY FEET TWIRLING MY HAIR SCREAMING INTO MY PILLOW
"Mikey: i want to take down the Nanny Mafia!! Gabriel:...why? Mikey: they didn't let me in the slide!! Gabriel: 😒 Mikey: and they called Davina a ""Lazy Cow""!!!!! Gabriel: 🔫 🙂 more"
mikey #1 davina defender
the nanny mafia kid’s facial expressions down the slide has me dead (also the smile gabe gave Davina when he said I know u will 👀👀👀 bro is enamored)
Awwwwe!!!!!! Isn't Mikey implying that Davina is an Angelini? 🤭🤭🤭
Not the duck having the same hairstyle as Gabriel and Mikey 🤣🦆
“Sorry your nanny is a lazy cow” THE BLASPHEMY! Take her down Mikey
maybe Davina can have a friend that she can relate to? Hope Jo doesn't have any alterior motives like the previous nannies she's come across...
"Gabriel: i dont want Mikey to be a part of this life🙏 Mikey: i want to take down the Nanny Mafia for calling Davina a ""lazy cow"" Gabriel: exceptions can be made🙃"
This episode is criminally short 🤯
AND THAT ONES THE LEADER
Uggo Nanny: “Sorry your nanny is a lazy cow..” Mikey: “So anyways I started blasting….”
GUYS I LOVE JOSEPHINE
“I’m sorry we blew up your hotel.” 😭😭😭
Mikey defending Davina with the Angelini honor is precious 🥺
Davina: “we’ll keep him safe” Gabriel: “I know YOU will”  👀
Bahah Mikey’s first nemesis 🤭
"Ma’am, we do not tolerate Davina slander. Please apologise promptly."
"G: You're getting Nico. D: If I must. We'll keep him safe. Thinking ""him"" is Nico, not Mikey. LOL"
DAVINA AND GABES MOMS??? - why r they so hot tho  - the apples don’t fall too far from the trees 👀👀
I knew it! I knew she knew something!!! is that Davinas mom FRIENDS WITH GABES MAMA?!?!?!
god damn their moms are hot
DAVINA'S MOM HAD THOSE SAME EARRINGS IN EPISODE 1. THE FAMILIES HAVE HISTORY AND MAMA AND DAVINA WILL MEET WHAT IS GOING ONNNNN
"i love how davina said ""they'll get their just desserts"" and actually gave mikey a cookie 😂😂"
That one kid ripping out of his coat like The Incredible Hulk lol.
“I gladly filmed it” Nico is so me😭
i see where gabriel and davina get their beauty from
BADDIE MOM DUO - DAVINA AND GABE ARE MEANT TO BE
"""Little turf war"" bro acting just like his father 😂"
Mikey and Louis is unstoppable respectfully 🤑
davina rewarding mikey for jailbreaking the other little kids 😂😂
"So...two things come to mind. First, Gabriel is older than Davina by more than a handful of years. Is this why Davina doesn't appear to recall Gabe from earlier in her life? Second, Davina's necklace — what's the chances it was a gift from Gabe's mother to Davina's mother?"
DAVINA AND GABES MOMS WERE BESTIES!!!! AHHHHHHHH!!!!! This is a good sign
Louis missed the perfect chance to yell VIVE LE REVOLUTION! 😭
UMM HELLO?? GENETICS?? 😩
"There is NO WAY Gabe hasn't seen photos of Davina's mom. Seriously, I'm pretty sure it's why he picked her from her photo alone."
IF GABRIEL’S MAMA FINDS OUT HER SON IS CRUSHING ON DAVINA OH MY GODDDDD
free the prisoners!!!
I love how all the top comments are about how hot the moms are 💀💀
"what's going ooooon? Mothers were besties, this can't be a coincidence. Take all my coins, I need to know the truth about Davina's parents 😭"
“What are they playing?” “Prison break 🥰🥰”
...and that explains why she didn't spill the tea to Val😏
"""if you raise something in captivity, is it good to keep it captive?"" mikey out here asking the REAL questions 😂😂"
"Everyone is playing checkers, while Davina is ten steps ahead of everyone playing chess with her excellent spy skills!"
i knew that police officer from earlier was suspicious... 😒😒
Nico: this is such a toxic work environment  Me: NICO youre in the FUCKING MAFIA 🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Ok but why did the police officer draw Gabe so… ✨smoldering✨. “Yeah, we’re looking for a silver fox with piercing blue eyes. A straight 10. If he doesn’t make your knees quake, you’ve got the wrong man.”"
why is this police guy so FINE
“I am always two steps ahead.” -nikicado avocado
"Hello mr heterochromia cop man 😏 I know you’re about to cause problems for my mafia duo, but still…purrr"
Mikey pulling out the big guns with these questions at the zoo huh
"I just love how Val is shook at how Davina is out here playing 3D chess while Gabe is like siping his expresso like ""She doesn't need to try. She slays just by breathing."""
NICO IN HIS LITTLE GLASSES AHHHH 😍😍😍
"“This is Davina getting serious” “Be careful what you wish for, huh?” SDFSDFGHVVDDSSVBHHGFSSJKS"
I love how Davina keeps trying to replace Nico with Adam but it never works out 💀💀
"Devina: ""How bout we go with black tie #12?"" Mickey: ""No 'Vina! That one's a *insert name here* fine silk tie for dinner on the beach. Black tie #2 is a *insert name here* with a silk-poly blend that was made for the Zoo!"" 😤 Davina: *I literally can't tell the difference but whatever*"
I knew that police dude was gonna be back. There’s no way you make a character that beautiful for just one episode.
The snapgram comments 💀 “mommy? sorry. mommy?”
Val questioning if Davina’s spying on them but Gabriel just sitting there like that’s my girl 😍
A brother perhaps?
New affirmation: I am the handsomest duck in the pond
Who took all my coins? The mafia nanny did!
"I am definitely looking forward to the crew attending the Monaco F1! Also ohhhh Verona? 😎 I sense new adventures in the future! Are we adopting the ""keep your friends close but your enemies closer"" strategy? Verona also has some interesting Shakespearean undertones to it also.... hmmmmm 😎"
"Wait a minute, isn't the guy at the end the same guy who was at the hotel when Davina and Mikey were helping to clean up?"
i wanna know what they did to the cop 👀
Okay Adam I see you 👀
even lavigne can see the sparks between gabe and davina 😏😏
Ooh so Gabriel only takes his suit off for davina hmm?? Interesting filing that info for later 😏  Also Adam the lady killer is crazy 😆  Edit: AHH!! My first top comment and the creator liked it TYSM 🙇🏻‍♀️
Based adam lore
Davina is so cutesy with her loose hair 😍
"Okay that conversation between Gabe and Madame Lavigne!!! This might be me reading between the lines like a pro/fangirl but several things. First, Gabe doesn't correct her when she brings up the rumors of him having a thing with Davina, ayy. Second, the only thing he does is push back when she says it is a weakness because he knows that Davina is a strength!!"
Mikey and Louis had the ultimate rich kids' playdate!
MY JAW DROPPED. DAVINA LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL IN HER NEW OUTFIT.
ADAM LORE IM LOVIN IT
"Louis's mother is sharp, she picked up what we all know. 😉"
damn adam and that racing suit go hand in hand 🤤
How does a race car driver get caught up in the mafia?! I hope we get a backstory on Adam soon!
ADAMS A WHAT!!!
AHHH no because ADAM is a racer😭 so glad we got lore of him he’s my favorite character
"This might be crazy to think but Gabe has said it before he wants people to underestimate Davina and I think he’s knowingly or unknowingly using it to his advantage. She will become a “higher” target  for his enemies than Mickey. But she’s capable of handling/defending herself which makes him okay with his decision to use her in this way. What will backfire are his feelings for her will definitely show more, the deeper the danger gets."
"Adam the driver… Adam Driver… anyway, I’m looking forward to learning more about his background next week! 😄🏎️🏎️🏎️🏁"
"the obvious confirmation that Gabe can read Davina at a glance and chooses what would make her the most comfy 💕 the way Gabe saves the speedo for moments when his guard is down/the new light this ep sheds on his ""this isn't enough access for you?"" comment from the first pool day 💕 the way Davina so easily calls that image of him to mind 💕 how we all know exactly how Gabe's going to react to this new outfit next week"
DAVINA IN THAT OUTFIT THO 😍😍
The fact that Davina knows that Gabriel never gets a sunburn😭
“Is that why you wear all those awful shirts?” 🤣😭💀 Mikey is my spirit animal.
the only reason why i like mondays now
Here’s a little conspiracy theory I wanted to share! I think Gabriel’s missing wife was hired by the uncle. I don’t think she was killed but ordered to leave him by the uncle. I think the uncle did this as punishment for when Gabriel began making plans to leave. I could be wrong but that’s my hunch at the moment!
i think i’m in love with adam
Ooh mystery man please make Gabriel jealous over Davina 😭
the way davina rejected that guy with so much class ✨️👏🏽✨️
Davina is Gabriel’s good luck charm 😭
the way she's so adamant on davina going to the ball is suspicious... 😒😒
HOW IS IT EVERYONE CAN SEE HE HAS FEELINGS FOR HER BUT HER
the way gabriel looked at her after they mentioned the race car driver 😏😏
"At one side, I love seeing Gabriel showing his obvious affection and jealousy, but on another one HE NEEDS TO KEEP IT TOGETHER 🥲"
Lavigne is low key a wingwoman trying to hook up Gabriel and Davina ASAP 😂😂
Do i see jealousyyy👀
I feel Davina is gonna get kidnapped or something because of the way Miss Girlie is acting
"Damn Gabriel, everyone can read you like a book 🫣"
Pink Cow gives you wiiiiings
Davina was very demure and very mindful when she rejected the race car driver 💅
“furrari” to avoid a lawsuit i presume 💀
omg Lavigne must feel so beleaguered to be tied to this useless heterosexual man who's being SO obvious after they JUST HAD THIS CONVERSATION rhfjfjgj
"So…are we in a love pentagon now, is that it? With most loves centered on Davina?🤔"
As an F1 girlie this episode was giving!
"At this point, I'm convinced that only Davina and Mikey haven't got a clue about Gabriel's feelings for her. He makes it so obvious! STICKER"
"Wait, wait, wait...is Alice really interested in Davina, or is she fishing for information? Gabe doesn't handle it well, loses his cool tipping off Alice that Davina is another weakness. Recall, too, that Davina has been perceived as an intelligence operative; is Alice trying to validate this? Gabe's wishy-washy response only makes Davina look more so. (⁠⊙⁠_⁠◎⁠)"
"Ok. I have a feeling I’m going to be downvoted for this one, but so be it 😆 I would almost ship Davina and Adam, if Gabriel wasn’t an option 😅😅😅"
“which means this hear furrari will take gold” LECLERC‼️‼️CHARLES LECLERC 🗣️‼️CHARLES LECL-*cough* *cough*
I think we can all read the room
1) love the emphasis on 'devil' when Davina walks in since her last name means devil 🤭 and 2) looks like Alice was able to confirm a weakness if she saw Gabriel's jealousy 😬
As much as I thank the author for this I also wanna thank Beyoncé for this
NOT GABRIEL GETTING JEALOUS 😭
"GIRL YOU SNIFFED HIM AND FALL ASLEEP ON HIM, YOU KNOW HE WOULD BE (AND IS) GOOD TO YOU"
awee but lightning mcqueen guy is kinda cute
"THEORY: I think how Gabe is reacting to Davina, especially in the last scene, hints that it’s very likely his relationship with his former wife was arranged. And for the author to have Davina say “his wife disappeared only a year ago” is a great seed to plant so that we start to question, “Well if that’s the case, why is he also matching her affections. Something doesn’t add up.” Gabe is acting more like a man who’s never had a first love/ trusted anyone rather than someone in mourning."
that's my girl! 👏 a 👏 good 👏 father 👏 doesn't 👏 mean 👏 a 👏 good 👏 man 👏 (but he will be for you and we can wait patiently)
I love how this ended! Gabe making the driver run off and then his blush! too cute. also loving how Mikey scored a point finally but at the same time he knows it'll be his loss when she gets payback lol.
“Naturally~” *kicks feet* hehe
AWW GABRIEL'S FLUSTERED FACE AT THE END 🥹🥹
The last three weeks of chapters were just setup for Gabriel's face in the last panel
IS THE SLOW BURN FINALLY BURING?!?
Every week we are left so thirsty… can’t wait to see Gabriel not controlling himself anymore
"The “Naturally” that Gabriel spoke from his lips weren’t an excuse or a lie, but Gabriel is indeed an admirer of her. People might say he is actually in love with her; Who knows?"
NOT GABRIEL HAVING HIS OWN SCENT NOW WITH APPLES LIKE DAVINA’S SCENT IS ORANGES 😆
"Hate to admit it, but I wouldn’t have minded Davina and this F1 cutie for an episode or two 👀"
Davina falling asleep and leaning on Gabriel’s shoulder😭😭
The way this man STIFFENS up when Davina lays on his shoulder is 😩   OMG MOMMY IM FAMOUS🤣🤣🤭🤭
I bet that shoulder’s cozy….
"gabriel, you can admit you were acting jealous 😏😏"
"Wow, what an amazing mix of cute wholesome family bonding, reminders that THEYRE STILL THE BAD GUYS, and Gabe being an embarrassment. This might be one of my fave chapters yet."
"Awwwww, I kinda want a nice happy, lovey-dovey ending for the racer. He looked very... out of shape after the mafia games, and there is nothing worse for a sports person than to believe they're jinxed"
Mikey got his first win!....but at what cost
Gabriel getting jealous when he sees that guy trying to flirt with Davina!
Adam making fun of Davina gives me life
GABRIEL WAS SO CUTE WHEN HE WAS LITTLE
The way I dropped everything I was doing and clicked on this episode so fast is actually insane
"wow, the genes in the angelini family are STRONG 😳😳"
Nooo why is it so short this week ? 😭  that being said I can totally picture Davina getting roasted on the regular by Adam & Nico about that nap 😂 that just made my day 👍
"Okay theory here, but what if Gab and his parents tried to leave the mafia before and maybe ran to Davina’s parents for help. The brother-in-law found out and killed his brother and Davina’s parents. Remember he is not above killing family if they go against the mafia. And maybe that is why he is watchful of Gab…"
I kept scrolling up and down and up again just to see the way he looked at Davina WITH SUCH TENDERNESS MY GOD
Davina and Adam are giving brother sister vibes i’m here for it😭
RAHH THE BEGGINING WAS SO FRIGGEN CUTE
Gabriel trynna let Davina sleep by closing the damn window on adam
LMAO the way Mickey really wasn’t lying when he said his dad was blond not gray💀🤣
Please y'all I can't wait for the moment Davina and the mom get one on one time
"Gabriel even looking at Davina when she’s walking away in front of his mama, he’s bold. Mama gonna find out sooner or later"
THE WAY GABS MOM DROP HER TOUGH ACT FOR MIKEY IS EVERYTHING
Mikey is definitely Gabriel's mini me
"THEORY: When Gabe’s mom says “there are some paths you can’t un walk.” I’m sure she refers to being in the mafia/ planning escape, maybe the death/ disappearance of his wife, or POTENTIALLY his involvement (in his youth- hinted with young Gabe photo) with the murder of Davina’s parents. And taking Davina in under his wing is his way of absolving some guilt. If his mom recognizes Davina- it’s not unlikely that her words were loaded there. 👀 There’s hints of an escape plan for sure"
"""Do I look dull to you"" was such a good response!!!"
1) Adam and Davina's big sibling energy 2) why does Gabe look more handsome with each chapter 3) Gabe's tender look at Davina   happy thanksgiving indeed 🇨🇦 more
"Gabriel looking at Davina and getting cut by Adam is just the cutest moment 💕 I guess it’s true, it’s obvious how they have feelings for each other  ❤️❤️❤️"
Eeek I can’t wait for Davina to prove herself to Gabriel’s mom. I hope she’ll give us more insight into Davina’s past life.
wait.. why is gabriel’s mama kinda fineee🤭🤭🤭 LIKE TELL ME IM WRONG
NOT MIKEYS LITTLE BOUNCING WHEN WAITING FOR HIS GRANDMOTHER 😭😭😭
"THIS WAS TO SHORT 😭 But it tells sooo much about Gabriel's family dynamic, also how will Davina and the Mom's interaction go with her knowing Davina's parents, the stage is set! I'm excited 😁"
mikey casually exposing everyone at dinner to his grandma 😂😂
Bro I’m just reading and my mom comes next to me saying “have the kissed yet” 😭 Even my mom wants to know
HIS FIRST MARRIAGE WAS ARRANGED! I KNEW IT
"AAAAAHHHHH I did NOT expect Mikey's grandmother to be SUCH a girl's girl ✨️💖✨️. She clocked Davina straight away, and was even warning her not to get involved in ""The Business"" (including her son!!) for Davina's safety! Now I'm sooooo curious to know more about Davina's mom and Mikey's grandmother: what was their story?"
“You have her eyes” had never gone harder
everyone’s ashamed faces at the dinner table is KILLING ME😭😭😭
Gabriel defending davina 🥺🥺 this is why im excited for my Monday’s to end😂
The brief backstory on Davina and Gabriel’s mother’s friendship 😭
Wait… chat Davinas dad. Looks like Nico 🤯
"I felt their panic, nothing is more terrifying then a kid telling the absolute truth to people who are better off not hearing it😂."
THE MARRIAGE WAS ARRANGED I CALLED IT. now I can finally ship them without feeling super guilty😊
"Gabe trusts Davina with so much but so little at the same time??? Tell her about your wife, about your desire/plan to get Mikey out, about your damn feelings!!!!!"
OHHHHHH and the truth comes out…Imagine your mum’s best friend being your new mother in law and the mother of your employer 😭😭😭
She’s not holding the secret back!!! She’s willing to wait until Davina is ready to hear it I AM SOBBING AT THE MOVIES STOP 😭😭😭😭
"I’m glad that Gabes mother isn’t going to tell him about Davina. But at the same time I’m scared with what’s going to happen when it all comes out, especially with the mum telling Davina she knows what actually happened to her parents😨"
I'm so jealous of the person who's gonna pick up this webtoon a year from now.  The once a week releases are killing me!!!
"Amelia Bremerton, the real MVP of the series 😆"
"💡🤔 Theory: There’s definitely more to the Emmaline story than just “soft and naive.” Heavily implied that she was an inside plant/ traitor set to break up the familia when mama says, “THAT much was clear.” Especially when connecting this convo to the warnings of previous betrayal to Gabriel concerning his “partners.” 👀"
She’s trying to protect Davina in her way and I appreciate her for it so dang much.
"""she's more than that"" oh? OH? IS SHE NOW? U GONNA PUT A RING ON IT?"
"lately there have been a lot of choices davina has made that she wouldnt have made in season one. Some might blame this on gabrielle, but I honestly think shes coming to terms with who her parents truly were as people.  Realizing, like him, she is a fruit grown from a Mafia family tree and in order to uncover her past, she has to understand it. You can’t uncover the truth without getting your hands dirty."
And here goes Mikey taking all my coins again 🪙😂 this kid is going to sell their souls before they know it I swear 😂
THE AUTHOR MUST’VE BEEN SMILING AT ALL OUR ARRANGED MARRIAGE THEORIES SINCE WE WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG
"aww gabriel looked so heartbroken hearing davina say ""not forever"" 🥺🥺"
"i love how gabe keeps checking in on her and making sure she’s ok, it’s just a sweet gesture— NOW KISS.😭🙏🏾"
"Gabriel still thinks that Davina doesn't have any feelings for him, just kiss already 😭😭"
“She’s made her feelings clear” BOY YOU HAVE NO IDEA
And we’re in our misunderstandings era… everyone’s FAVORITE webtoon trope 😭
"gabriel: ""that dish has been clean for 5 minutes"" how would you know unless you've been watching her the whole time 😏😏"
No!! Gabriel please that’s your future wife!! MF LOCK INNN!!!😫
Both Gabriel and Mikey want Davina to stay with them forever 😭😭
"NU-UH, you were holding each other in Ep 40 saying ""just the THREE of us"", don't you take that sentiment back- you've BLED together! Rip my heart out and STOMP on it with a golf cleat! 🫵 YOU PUT THE POISON IN ME!!"
"Something is SO GONNA HAPPEN between them at the ball, I just know it 🤭"
"since this is the angst/misunderstanding each other’s feelings chapter, the next chapter better have a whole TEN panels of Gabe’s confession or I don’t want it🤺🤺🤺🤺"
I like that Davina didnt’t lie to Mikey by promising forever. Also love how Gabes keep looking out for Davina. Bittersweet ep for sure
"I can't wait to see how the ""purely professional capacity"" falls apart at the ball 😏"
This is the only reason I look forward to Mondays😼
gabriel and davina both assuming the other doesn't have feelings for them 😔😔
"headmistress literally said not all footprints are digital,, anyway are we in the miscommunication trope now 😭😭"
"Ooh I think Gabriel is realising that Davina eventually leaving would make Mikey feel like he's losing a mother all over again. This'll just put into perspective how much he wants her to stay, because now Mikey wants that too."
"fam, are we ready to see gabe’s attempt at setting a boundary fail spectacularly?"
The heartbreak on his face in the last panel. 😭😭
Gabriel thinking his mom told Davina about his feelings and thinking she’s rejected him is so sad 😭
Oh he’s down bad. 🫢
Gabriel thinking Davina doesn't like him back😭
not gabe being salty about thinking that davina doesn’t like him 😂
