DISCOVER SQUADDD
"I’ve always wanted to say this... DISCOVER SQUAD ASSEMBLE!! edit: did anyone else find the comic through the YouTube channel? If not from here or YouTube where? I’m very curious. edit2: also I hope whoever is reading this has a wonderful day and know that they are loved and appreciated. Edit 3 this is in 2024, to all those who are rereading, I hope things are better now and you know you are still loved and appreciated; for those reading for the first time, I hope you have a wonderful life <3 more"
Counted down the minutes like it was New Years. Welcome back.
I guess his 4th relationship this month is comin
"Congratulations on making to Originals you deserve it! Edit: Everyone I know will probably say ""Earth to [Redacted]"" while I'm reading this Webtoon.😅"
If his personality is like that how did he get so many girlfiends??
Where the OGs at?
DO YOU REMEMBER THE TIME...when this webtoon had 12 episodes
"Kade, back with that weird obsession of a certain smth? 😂😉"
Oh my god that cat though. 😻😻
DISCOVER SQUAD WHERE WE AT i have MISSED THIS SO MUCH AHHHHH
"Everyone in this webtoon is so attractive, even the random customers"
"Even though I feel for him, that chick was right. He's wasting everyone's time and feelings that he's dating while he's not really into it."
"Ahhhhhhhhhhh yay I’ve missed down to earth sooo much, welcome back"
I was so happy I squealed and concerned my roomate.
CANVAS CREW
"OMG, it's back I literally sreamed when I got the notification"
did anyone else get the zylith has seen some aliens notification? and was secretly hoping that this was gonna be a crossover of some sort? just me? ok
I thought I'm here for free coins but I think I'm here to read another story that I'm going to be addicted to.
I thought it's our soft boy aka cinamon roll aka sleeping seaweed's Zylith but oh.....its not.
That notification really confused me
free coins if i reread one of my favorite series? done
"She's even more beautiful than she already was, the art improved so much !!"
"did any one else read ""the rumor come out is Bruno Mars gay?"" on the computer?"
That's just Starfire with turquoise hair.Kade is just a depressed Robin.
Y’all. She’s so pretty wtf
Almost had Starfire moment. Guess her species doesn't kiss to get a new language.
"Anyone else notice in the Earth description ""The rumor come out does Bruno Mars is gay?""😂😂😂"
Funny. The language she was speaking looked a lot like my math homework.
is he still into collar bones?
I’m not the only one that tried reading the alien text right....
I think she ment she comes in peace
"The rumor come out, Does Bruno Mars is gay?"
Is it just me or is she a lot THICCER then I remembered
"The rumor come out, does Bruno Mars is gay"
He said  : 👁👄👁 She really said: 😚✌🏻
DISCOVER SQUAD WHERE YOU AT!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
Who else read the panel where he falls in her ship and sees her language? XDD

"Me: Mom, I’m bisexual My mom: really? How did you find out? Me: a comic"
Did anyone else see the does Bruno Mars is gay Easter egg in the wreck part?

"When an animated character looks cuter than you😭😭😭  Edit: okay guys I get it’s not animated , just saying in general😭"
THIS WAS DEFINITELY WORTH THE WAIT
I’ve literally watched the clock all day waiting for this! Welcome back and CONGRATS ON FEATURED!!! ❤️💕🎉
Is it just me or did zaida become dummy thicc
Whenever I like someone’s house I will is say “your house is delicious”
"Zaida used puppy dog eyes, it was supper effective."
I JUST REALIZED SHE REMINDS ME OF STARFIRE This is basically like an alt meeting between Robin and Star from teen titans and I love it
ITS BACK AND ZADIAS EYES ARE SOMEHOW EVEN MORE STUNNING THAN “EYE” REMEMBER....ok ima head out for that lame pun 😢
DISCOVER SQUAD??? (ew i refuse to call it canvas)
Cats vibrate?never thought of it that way
Me: *reading in starfire’s voice*
Anyone else hear her in Starfire’s voice?
Zaida be thicker than a snicker-
Clavicle
Why does she remind me of starfire and oh from home lol
*takes a deep breathe* *exhales* I see I’m already invested emotionally
During the cat scene did anyone else get Home vibes from it cause I thought of Oh
Aww I kinda liked the other story cause it was funny when Kade realized she could fly a WHILE later
2 questions: is he still going to be into collar bones and is there still going to be a Pookah or did you just replace them with Cosmo?
“Does it wish to do a Burgle” is the most fantastic sentence I’ve ever seen😂
Am I the only one who hears her voice as Starfire
She reminds me of Starfire from teen titans!
Oh that 3rd rule is definitely gonna be broken.
I get the JoJo reference
*collarbone*   Edit: Thank you for the likes and comments I’m so happy other people remember it.
I feel like her thighs are more thicc than before and I am NOT complaining. I can't wait for Kade to notice her collarbone. 😉😂
乇乂丅尺卂 丅卄工匚匚
THICC LITTLE PEAR lol 🍐🍐🍐
and they were roomates-
I love the way he said dayum
I love how she’s talking. It reminds me of Starfire from the old Teen Titan cartoon
I can hear “EXTRA THICC” echoing in this scene
It’s mister Yoons rule all over again and we know it’s gonna be broken 😏
the cat knows 😏
He like: she's thicc?! and she looks like a little pear!  and the cat like: ohh i see what were you thinking ;)
DESTROY NUMBER THREE (we all know it will be destroyed anyway 😏)
Old Version: Collarbone Fetish - New Version: Thigh Fetish
Daniel yoon said no feelings but he already yeeted that out so F*CK RULE 3
"what's that Nick Fury quote ""I acknowledge the council's decision but given that it's a stupid decision, I have decided to ignore it"""
Love the not Dance Gavin Dance T-shirt!
rule 4: ignore rule 3
Thicc Thighs Save Lives
Aww kinda disappointed that I didn’t get to see her try to undress in front of him and her eating soap in the shower from discover :(
Pfft. feelings gon happen when feelings gon happen
My boi: Rule #3 no feelings || Earlier: Dayumm she thicc || Me: BOI WDYM! YOU LITERALLY JUST SAID THAT SHE WAS THICC AND DONT LIE U WAS BLUSHING H A R D
You’re getting bad vibes because you left an alien who knows almost nothing about your planet by herself in your house XD. You SHOULD be having bad vibes right now XD.
"Oh Kade..your house is about to get blown up Edit: My first ever top comment on Webtoon, holy shit😳😄😁"
“You are very ugly.” *SPLURT!!* LMFAO SAME KADE.
Her raw English reminds me of starfire
Zaida: “You are very ugly” kade: hello darkness my old friend..
"I meant unique, I swear"
“You are very ugly” this Webtoon is a goldmine
"Please take note, I am not ugly, I am unique 😂"
Zaida is literally a rated R version of starfire.
“You are a bit ugly-“ me: I know
I just hope the cat gets fed...
“I’m getting bad vibes” house blows up behind him
I really like his sleeve. I legit might get that tattoo in the future.
I cant be the only one who reads her dialogue in Starfire's voice
I wonder what that sign she does with her hand means
Maybe because you left an alien by herself who knows literally nothing about the Earth and on top of that you left her to take care of your precious cat...but you know that's just a theory
"I’m sitting here wondering how can he afford a nice car, live by himself in a spacious looking house, own a cute cat, and feed himself on a cashier budget!? I can handle the sexy magical alien girl but how can you afford your place, mistah!"
"ah yes I am familiar with that look ""unique"""
"""You are very ugly"" Me on a daily basis"
"You basically did the equivalent of leaving a five year old by herself and was like “hey, don’t set the house on fire.”"
"Well, all things considered I’ll be impressed if the house is not on fire when he comes back."
"""you are very ugly"" ""OH MAH STARS I MEANT UNIQUE"" who says unique in that face? (what I'm saying is look at her face when she says""u r very ugly"" and replace unique)"
"Zadia: ""how lewd!"" *proceeds to be horny on main*"
"*Offended*  ""Why does he have such lewd images?""  *keeps looking*"
"ah man i used my coins just to read through this story again (read the old one before it was a original) and i love seeing you doingit  again, keep up the awesome work pookie"
Kade that battery percentage for social interactions...I feel that in my soul.
I SMELL AN EX GIRLFRIEND BOX!
BRO! What if she could communicate with the cat! Think about it! She learned kades language! What if she does the same with the cat! Oml I love this story and can’t wait!!!!!!
STAR BOOM! I CANT GET OVER THESE OBVIOUS REFERENCES
"Me, the introvert, relating to his battery percentage"
Zaida: Booty booty Booty booty and... more booty
Kade at his job is the most relatable thing omg
""" Is kade a pervert? "" *proceeds to be a gay alien and look more at the lewd photos*   ( okay but I felt this on a spirtual level LMAOOOOOOOO )"
the cat protected her innocence all hail Cosmo
Don't even care anymore take all my coins Pookie!!  Seriously love the way the manager never gets his name right 🤣
"omg a star bomb shirt, game grumps confirmed as DLC"
"A ""Star Bomb"" reference!? 10/10 Webtoon"
who else reads this with starfires voice
STARBOMB!!!
Never thought I'd see a Starbomb reference.  Hella cool!
ugh all the top comments are about the lewd part and not the box SERIOUSLY THO
STARBOMB!
WHO ELSE SPENDS COINS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT BEAR TO STOP READONG omg this is so good btw🥺💗
the Starbomb and dance Gavin Dance references
star bomb check yeah
Well she's gonna be an angel cuz Kade's about to kill her 😂
Kade.exe has stopped working please try again
"F to pay respects Replies 1,424 91126 261 Christopher Escobedo Jan 28, 2020 QUICK GET THE RICE"
KADE HAS THE HOTS ALREADY HE WANTED TO SEE HER IN CUTE LITTLE ANGLE OUTFIT
"It’s ok, the PS5 is coming out soon. Bear with it, soldier."
911? yeah I'ma about to commit a murder in the name of revenge..
i felt that in my soul...
"girl, the esc button is on the top row of the keyboard, I suggest you use it now."
Kade: “I wonder if she is size Thicc or size Thiccc?”
My face was like😬
Aahhhhh yes. The old throw the Xbox in the sink and wash out the broken parts technique
Kade is a mood
"ugh, such a pure little soul."
Oh ho ho ho you have made a grave mistake young woman
QUICK SOMEONE GET THAT MAN A JUMBO ZIPLOCK BAG AND A TON OF RICE STAT!!!!
Please don’t kill her.
This is exactly why I hate clothes shopping as a pear shape. Sizing can be so difficult!
R.I.P to his one and probably only baby... my it Rest In Peace
"As a avid science and tech person, and as a gamer with Highfunctioning autism.  I wouldn’t care so much about the system than about my environment being disrupted."
RED ALERT RED ALERT! MAN IS ABOUT TO SPIKE ALIEN GIRL BACK INTO SPACE!
The precious child has drowned...
"As a gamer myself, I just cried a little and my heart chipped a bit, but I can’t blame this beautiful pear for not understanding that water and “precious child” don’t mix well 😭  EDIT: DUDE... my ps4 pro is taking a poop on me cause I’m a terrible owner and never clean out the dust that’s probably accumulated 😭 my “precious child” isn’t safe from any elements! 😱 lol"
If aliens are shaped like her sign me up for the invasion
Kade you tell her not to catch feelings but you do bullsh!t like this
Awe. You know when you're an introvert and you've found the one when they don't drain you but instead recharge you. Such a rare and beautiful find in this world 😭
kade be trying to clap alien cheeks😂😂
"I feel like Kade and Zadia are the only two moods I ever feel (apart from shrek , which I live and breathe)"
"duuuuude zaida FIESTY in this one. I think it’s an interesting addition to her character. I want to see more of zaida being smart and stuff, since she’s an alien and she has a SHIP you gotta have some elon musk stuff goin on up there. And i like that even though she was scared she stood up for herself, MAD LAD"
Rule 3: *exists* Literally everyone: YEEEEET
Pizza guy: Kade right?  No this is Patrick
awe looks like kade is already breaking the “no catching feelings rule”🥺🙈
He's H O R N Y
You know I was aaaallll proud of myself. I held off on paying for previews. Saw you updated and what happens? I decided to buy the next one. What's the worst that can happen? Then you go on ahead show me Starbomb shirts and cute chicks buying Satan night gowns! Thanks a lot jackass! I'll be here next week with 5 more coins. I hope you're proud of yourself.
"aliens like pizza, noted"
She is a bundle of sunshine and rainbows and she must be protected.
the THICC grants one energy
And this is why it is important to find someone who helps charge your social battery it is an important aspect of a life partner
Okay guys it’s time to start building my ship hmmm where’s my hammer
"Kade: It's for, ugh, you know. Zaida: You have boobs too?"
My new obsession 😍🥰
Hate it when guys in comics corner women like that. It's a stupid intimidation tactic and I will fight anyone who would ever try to pull that with me
"""no feelings"" buys her sexy nightgown"
Does anyone else imagine her voice as Starfire's from Teen Titans?
"GOD I hate it when boys in comics say dumb shit like ""men are dangerous y'know and I cOuLd bE oNe oF tHeM"" like okay thanks for reminding me that men are potentially rapist and that I could be harassed at any time ""if I'm not careful"" I really appreciate it"
did anyone else notice he wiped the icing off zaida and licked it? the ship sails ♡
Kade’s getting distracted by that clavicle. 😍
"Aww!! You know i just adore Zadia’s eyes and how they light up when she’s excited! Great job, Pookie Senpai! Can’t wait for the next update!!"
"I assume everyone is reading Zaida's lines in Starfire's voice, right?"
Kade knows how to do a girls hair better than I do....~{•~•}~
“Dubious food...” yo breath of the wild fans where you at???
"HE EYED THE COLLARBONE! I REPEAT, HE EYED THE COLLARBONE!"
Kade is the reason schools dress code shoulders.
Rule three is already getting broke
"brb, getting some Bokoblin fangs and ancient gears boiling..."
In disappointed at the lack of breath of the wild comments tbh
I love how he was blow drying her hair! So cuuuute🥰😳
There’s this new thing called FEELINGS and I think Kade is catching it
Kade isn’t a fan of sweets also kade licks frosting off of hand
Look at them growing together 🥺
I ship it so hard....
rule three is quaking in her boots
I’m in my twenties fan girling like a 10 year old at a Jonas brothers concert in the 2000s
those cupcakes lowkey look really good tho 🤔🙈
COLLARBONE
TINY TWO FINGER HIGH FIVE IT'S TO CUTE
HE ATE HER CHEEK ICING
"“Hi, can I have some ZAPLOONSNDJD please?"
"""misfortune of others is silly"" -*slow clap*- she's a keeper!"
"""Explosions are cool, Women are hot and the Misfortune of others is silly"" literally explains tv in a nutshell lmao"
"take my coins I don't care, was worth it 😆 edit: my first top comment! is it cheesy I'm editing it like every other person ever? oh well 🤷."
Ah next she'll learn about memes
Dude you should have put on PBS kids or veggie tails
"""Aliens!"" 👽 Nothing like a confused alien watching the guy on Ancient Aliens blame aliens for everything."
“women are hot!” couldn’t agree more
Steven universe! 🤩
"hey, did anyone else hear that crack in Rule 3 spreading?"
Rule 3 is shaking-
how is NO ONE COMMENTING ABOUT THE ALIENS GUY ON THE HISTORY CHANNEL. ITS GOLD
"Baby Metal, Steven Universe, memes.... i see Author is a woman of culture, i appreciate thw references! 😂❤"
"Well, this was a very steep slide straight into the FEELINGS, Kade. So much for rule #3, I guess."
is that.... STEVEN UNIVERSE?
STEVEN UNIVERSE!!
they turned on Steven Universe! IT'S PERFECT.
I saw Steven and my mood shot up immediately. Also bruh that rule 3’s not doing anything for this dood
Lap pillow is best pillow. Change my mind.
STEVE UNIVERSE !!!! BABY METAL !!!!!  Says In almighty voice* FINALLY OTHER WEEB I CAN RELATE TO (edit if u don’t know what baby metal is it is a Japanese heavy metal band
broo when she said women's are hot ahahha gay vibes🌈🤣
I mean she got the Woman Are Hot thing right
"No, no, just let her watch Steven Universe! It'll teach her a lot!"
Zay: *Starts drawing her own fanfic about her relationship with Kade lol* Readers: She's just like us! ❤️❤️❤️
She has become an Alien Weeb! Nothing can stop her now!
that better go on the fridge
ARE WE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT HIS MANAGER BLUSHING
Please hang that beautiful family photo on the fridge.
How 2 explain anime 2 alien fast:Alright I got this new anime plot.Basically there is this girl with some HUGE boobs I mean some serious honkers a real set of badonkers packing some dobanahangoros massive dahonkabankaloos big ol’ tonohongerecugars what happens next? Transfer student shows up with even bigger Bahonagahoogs HUMONGUS hongolonononogongus
I think... the boss... has a little crush 😳
Kade's manager is giving off some gay vibes and I'm kinda living for it
This webtoon has no right to be this wholesome
THE THIRD RULE HAS BEEN YEETED SOME TIME AGO
I always imagine her voice like Starfires voice.
That is so pure 🥰🥰🥺
THE PICTURE OF THEM TOGETHER. ITS SO PURE. I LOVE HER SO MUCH. 🥰🥰🥰
Oh my god she’s so cute I can’t
yeah dude!! there is nothing wrong with liking romance while also being 24
she is  p r e c i o u s
"""How do I explain anime culture to an alien?"" Bro, how do I explain anime culture to a human?"
Kade: Explaining anime culture. Zay: Is the anime culture manifested.
Yo if she becomes a model cuz of his manager?.......Imma have a nosebleed 🤤🤤🤤🤤
"SHE IS A 5 YEAR OLD, IN THE BODY OF A 20 YEAR OLD, AND HAS THIGHS THAT COULD CRUSH A PERSONS HEAD IN SECONDS! AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH"
So now I have a new ship. I can't help but ship kade and his manager THEY ARE SO CUTE TOGETHER
If Kade doesn't hang that drawing on the fridge then WHAT'S THE POINT
Am I the only one who imagines her voice as Starfire?? Just me? Ok... (edit: why is this top comment I am confusion rn lol thanks tho!) Edit 2: ok so there’s a lot of ppl pissed off I didn’t realize Zay was based off Starfire and some have said this comment before. I usually don’t read comments after I read my webtoons so I had no idea some have said this before me. Thanks to those however who were nice about it or just realized it as well. Next time I’ll just keep to myself haha.
I don't know why but I have a feeling that's his ex or it could be you know....LET ME SPEAK TO THE MANAGER Aka Kade's boss Aka noisy body.
"Mallmart at 2am is a wild place man, bold choice for the first venture out. Once saw a guy planking in a freezer case in a mallmart at 2am"
"It's not Kade's manager or the girl buying the nightgown. The hair is too long for either of them, plus the color is different from either. It's either Kade's ex or a friend of his.  edit: Maybe it is the girl buying the nightgown, I looked at her episode again. Def not the manager though."
she THICC.
Floating would be a great thing for most short girls trying to reach the top shelf 😂 being tall has its perks
no one's gonna talk about hey there Delilah? am I the only one that likes that song?
"Am I first? No way! Grocery shopping at 2am? Heck, if it means avoiding human interaction as much as possible, I’ll see you there Kade & Zay! 😂 Also, no need to buy dessert cause she’s got the cake. 🍑"
I think this is that customer he helped
And this is the moment that Brian knew he F***** up
Oh man Zay... Getting busted by the ex this soon into the webtoon. #blessyourheart
I think the stalker is the thicc girl from Spenders. The girl that bought the night gown. Her hair when she whips away looks like the same color.
THE TOOL SHIRT THE TOOL SHIRT
It’s definitely the chick who Kade talked to in the store about the nightgown.
Did any one else start singing hey there dahlia when it came on???
I don’t think they saw her flying.. they probably just saw him holding her
I feel like that person could be the girl from Episode 7 because the silhouette of that person in the mall is curvy like the girl...
Who wants to bet the strange figure is another of whatever Zay is.
tool 👌🏻😌
It’s definitely the manager he probably thinks he caught kade with his”girlfriend”
Umm... I was comparing their heights and it brought my mind to something... How old is Zaida?
So no ones gonna talk about the death pond hoodie... ok
"Breaking news, this WEBTOON is FAKE! Because the Nintendo Switch is NEVER on sale!"
She’s going to float right into his heart
Oh my god why are they so damn cute 🥺
THIS IS LIKE THE MOST ADORABLE WEBTOON EVER! I WANT THIS IN ANIME FORM!!! Mind yall I'm a 6 foot 220 pound former marine and I'm absolutely losing my mind over this lmao
that girl was that chick that bought something in the store and came back and started liking him because the way he smiled at her........ Also  When the next post?????
"For everyone wondering who the girl is, that’s one of the girls that shops in Spenders lol"
Is it just me or is she being drawn thiccer and thiccer?

"Kade: My heart is content"" ( ꈍᴗꈍ)"
"REMEMBER EVERYONE, ON APRIL 1 GO TO GOOGLE AND LOOK UP “BING” TO MAKE IT THE MOST SEARCHED WORD ON GOOGLE."
Rule of not falling in love is slowly being broken
what made really wants to ask is: is everyone from your planet  that thicc or is it just you?
im a grown-ass man. shouldnt be making 'awh' sounds out loud about a romance comic
THEY ARE SO ADORABLE I CAN’T
"I love the refrance to tool, enter the gungeon, doom(2016), smash , zelda, and Pokemon."
"MY SHIP IS FINALLY SAILING, ONWARD (づ❍□❍)づ"
He bought the plushie for her my heart needs help 🥺
GUYS!!! Stores have cameras! She was being recorded while floating!!
can we just note we were all wrong on who the mysterious person was
so we were on that cliffhanger hanger FOR A RONDOM GIRL THAT SPYS ON BOYS BECAUSE SHE HAD LOVE A FIRST SIGHT
I’m so fucking gay for this adorable alien
"You look at a pear when you draw Zaida don’t you? ’,:)"
so did cosmo ever make her the pancakes ? 🥺
aww she made him feel butterflies🥺
"baggage. that's what's in the box EDIT: Ok, my jaw literally dropped.  can't believe I got top comment.  tysm for thinking I'm funny n stuff.  author, you awesome ❤️"
he's catching feels and she just wants food. sounds right.
When Kade smashed that butterfly in the air I felt that vibe for a whole generation of 20 something year Olds 😂
"So far loving this. I'm a dude, yet, I'm falling in love with the story... I'm a manly man... with a soft heart...."
inside the box...is ANOTHER BOX
Oh heck she's gonna be wearing the ex girlfriend's clothes 💀
Kade: 'No fEeLiNgS'  Also Kade: *has feelings*
Zaida likes her pancakes like Kade likes his women.... thick and fluffy
HIS LOCK SCREEN💀
Let’s be friends.. THAT WAS SO PRECIOUS 🥺
manager: *gets on one knee* kade will you be my homie?
...his manager definitely likes him
it just me or does anybody else see how he was caressing the top half of a mannequin girl?!ಠ_ಠ
DANG BOI SHE THICC
WHEN HE ASKED TO BE FRIENDS 🥺🥺🥺
I've  read this 14 times now and I still can't believe Kade called our precious cinnamon roll *Dumb -Ass* 😲
Bruh it's probably stuff about his ex
"I'm just gonna say, I love this webtoon with all my heart"
I too would ask for friends while hiding behind/fondling a mannequin. social awkwardness is so relatable.
"When she said “i like they thick and fluffy” in my head I read it as “I like them big, I like them chunky” and the whole “I think Moto moto likes you” came to mind. I blame it on my siblings."
damn she THICCCCCCC
Hurry up and eat the evidence!!!!
DON’T PANIC! DO A DIVE BOMB NOW GIRL!
Hurry Zay and eat it! There’s not other choice! Edit: oh my gawd I comment this before I saw that someone else comment something similar before me. I am sorry I didn’t notice. Edit:2 if you guys would’ve been here when the episode first uploaded you would’ve seen that a lot of people had the same idea and that a lot of comments that said to eat it were posted at the same time. ( don’t care if you believe me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
don't be suspicious don't be suspicious 🎶
QUICK KISS HIM AS A DISTRACTION WHEN HE WALKS IN
and once again I bought my way into a cliffhanger
the only thing to do... is to eat it.
when you try your best and you don't succeed~
She could put it in all that THICK that she got😆
get naked. maybe he won’t notice..?😅
You have a bra now! Use it to your advantage!!!
Quick Zay use your powers and hide the evidence
hmmm wonder what zay is hiding🤔🤔🤔
cAn i HaVE ThiS gURLs HAiR PLEEEASSE!
Bet it’s photos of his ex
SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT
"Zay, I choose you! Use dive! Oh no, the epic boss, Kade is coming. Quick, eat the photo! *Kade uses yell* Zay, dodge!!! (From Pokem- I mean go cutie!)"
Yeet or eat... two options girl!
dat booty tho
"Nobody is gonna talk about the fact that she said we all have something we want to hide? And the fact that she started crying when she saw her planet's uniform? What if she lied when she said she ran away? What if she was kicked out or exiled? Or I'm just overthinking and she just misses her homeworld. Then again, why did she run away in the first place if she misses it? THERE ARE SO MANY PATHS THIS STORY COULD TAKE AHHHHHH"
🎶 and that’s why he’s called cliff hangerrrrr 🎶
im getting some gay vibes from the manager. he didnt want to say it so he wants to be friends with kade.
She’s legal EVERYBODY 👌
Ooo you better toss that pic cause a new QUEEN is in town😤
"I thought she had ate the picture at first lol. Anyways so glad they’re learning more about each other, can’t kick out a ship that’s already been built! 🥳"
Why was I expecting her to be over 1000  years old
i was scared as i was counting the tally’s on the paper 😭
Did anyone else have a mini panic attack counting the tally marks💀
"Kade will unclog a toilet for her, check to make sure she's of age, but then STILL bring up tHe RuLeS. I'm not buying it. They're basically already a married couple😂"
that lady in the pic is sooo pretty guys. I wonder what happened to her 🤔
Is it just me or is Kade getting HOTTER each episode 🥵
Was it just me or did they hype up her age just a little because most of us expected some crazy number
"Your supposed to quarantine her with you, not kick her out! COVID-19 Bro!!!"
"Anyone else reading Zay’s words in Starfire’s voice- from Teen Titans? 😅 No, just me? Okay...."
"""happy night"" is so cute to me"
Alien is not legal drinking age in the US: has been noted
Who else counted the lines before even reading how old she is🤣🤣
I dunno what's wrong with me I'm obsessed with this webtoon. it's like I'm seeing my real life crush in Kade. he is the same as him. (looks and attitude) he's kinda one of my best friends but he's not interested in me
EVERYONE DO THE FLOP!
he wasnt kidding when he said they look alike damn
For a fact I know Kade likes Zaida
Am I the only one who thought Zay would be older? 😥😂
Anyone else counted the tally marks before reading on? I know I did 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️
I counted 22 I’m stupid apparently
Zay in braids is literally the cutest
Zay wants rule 3 gone with that fluster
DON'T BE MAD KADE 😭 I just want him to throw everything away 🥺
"Zay is literally the next big webtoons artist, she drew that without even paying attention"
I feel bad for kade cause this is gonna hit him like a bus
She asked kade to free the paint brushes. This level of cuteness should be illegal
"Oh boy, I’m sending you all the luck I can Zay"
I'm so terribly invested in this story
Nobodies gonna point out Kade's eyes were blue for a second?
RULE 3 NEEDS TO BE GONE
“FRIENDS” with a ship on the side 😏
Rule 3 left the chat
These cliff hangers are killing me
zay is like anime starfire
ahhhh I want the next episode already! Pookie Senpai why must you make me wait for this!! ;-;

spent $4 to get here. I'm not even mad
Plz not let this be the end of our ship 😥
Is it me or did Kades eyes turn blue ..maybe it was just me
Lust: UNLOCKED
🥺 they're SO cute. The Red Dwarf had me and my husband dying 🤦🏼‍♀️
The biggest insult of 2020 #RED DWARF
rule 3 officially out the window boys
Red dwarf? More like a supernova coz my heart is exploding from all the cuteness ✨
"how could kade get mad at  zay, she’s literally a cinnamon roll🥺"
did anyone else notice her eyes weren't from yellow to black? is that I sign that shes upset or frustrated?
“Ask Alex” “Doodle” this webtoon has the best product displacement 😂😂
🥺👉👈😭 kade is so sweet to apologise to zay even though it really does hurt him. He understands that it's hard for her to understand because they are so different. But that difference let's their feelings grow towards one another and it's so beautiful 😭😭😭💕💕
It's so refreshing to see a male character own up to his mistakes so quickly and without having to be told where he went wrong. 💕 I'm sure he understands that Zay is incredibly curious and probably doesn't even understand what she found. His patience may be thin now but I think he's already growing to be a protective sweet heart that'd do anything for Zay.
I'm in love with this series. It's a shame I'm not going to be able to read any more for a while. I'm shipping out to boot camp for the marines and I wish all of you and the artist and everyone else involved with this the best of luck.  I'm back from bootcamp I've earned the title of Marine and thanks for all the support and love. I wish all of you stay safe and have a great day everyday.
"Honestly, imo Zay didn't really have a reason to be mad at him. She knew what she was doing and that he didn't want her going through his things. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
This actually went better than imagined in my head🤔
"Kinda upset how he had to apologize for being upset when he didn't do anything wrong in the first place, it was HIS privacy being invaded"
"""I'll do what I can to make that happen"".....I felt that on a spiritual level....doing everything in your power to give someone the happiness you struggle to find yourself, hoping that this time it really WILL be different? I mean, I have no idea what that's like😖🙁"
My new favorite insult will now be: Red Dwarf
is nobody gonna talk about the fact that she was mad at him for being mad at her mistake and when he tried to talk about his emotions she talked about hers instead ? okay
"Yeah. I'm going to have to say no to this episode. He had Every right to be upset. He gave her a boundary, and she crossed it. I HATE when the one who is wronged is guilt tripped into apologizing as if THEY did something wrong. Still love the artwork, though."
Zay telling him to open his eyes but he keeps refusing.....THE SYMBOLISM!
"“Kade is a red dwarf!” Me, an astronomy nerd: *dying of laughter*"
"Ok, I'm not mad at Zay or anything but like why did she get mad at Kade? She went through his stuff and found something personal even after he told her to stop, and because he got upset with her she insulted him and made HIM apologize? Idk. Yea she said sorry too, but like he should still be allowed to be upset with her without her being mad that he didnt instantly forgive her. That's just my opinion on the situation tho."
honestly I thought his reaction was perfectly appropriate. he very clearly and calmly explained that she crossed a line and had betrayed his trust.  the only thing he did which wasn't ok was calling her a dumbass and that was only after she kept insisting he react differently just because of her apology. he had every right to feel upset and she acted like he shouldn't be mad just because she apologized. she should have been prepared to give him some time and space after confessing more
"Kade, why did you apologise? You getting upset was well within your right to be upset at her going through your stuff. Ok, it was sort of a mistake that she saw the picture, but she did open the box. And Zay, why are you getting mat at him? You already suspected he would be upset, so why get mad at him doing what you expected? This is why guys sometimes stop trying. They are damned if they do  and damned if they don't, and always having to apologise, even if it isn't their fault"
"the new comic comes out: pay 5 coins Me: let me in, LET ME IIIIIINNN!!!!"
Rule 3? never heard of it.
kade sure does love some collarbones
I bet he danced with his girlfriend that why he’s crying
"OH MY GOSH!!! ""Lawman"" in the video scene is a reference to Marshal Law and it's a video about Ruminate!!! I Love finding the hidden support artists put in for each other ♥️"
"""Why would I be crying dumbass?""  its like they're already married."
Oh my gosh imagine how much he must trust Zay if he's able to cry so freely in front of her! He's put up such a large wall and she is flying right over it. 💕✨
"This must be so hard for Kade. Like you broke up from a 4 YEARS relationship probably not too long ago. And then you invite an ALIEN into your home which in all the odds, looks similar to your ex who most likely hurt you😣"
can we applaud the fact there is a man crying and that it is not shown as a flaw or a weekness :)
"JACKSEPTICEYE, GAME GRUMPS, AND A LET'S PLAY CAMEO????? YISSSSSSSSS"
"Kade has a lot of issues that have not been resolved, which makes sense since he was in a relationship for four years.  I personally have been in a relationship for five years... and when... things didn't work... it left me... broken... so this webtoon does mean a lot to me and how the author is able to get the feels in... is so accurate that it is scary.   I know exactly what Kade is feeling and going through... to be honest... just like him... I haven't recovered either."
You know..kissing will make you feel better
Dance dance cry revolution
We in it now friends. He’s moving on
RUMINANTE!!!!
I'm not crying my eyes are just sweating
"Im dying at ""Greeneyeboy"""
RUMINATE! IS THAT A LETS PLAY REFERENCE
"I know some of those YouTube channels, so Marshall Law, Jacksepticeye, and GameGrumps?"
"is that a Let's play cameo i spot? also fuck, I'm out of coins now"
omg i saw pookie
"Damn, kade’s ex hurt him more than what we think she did ."
I saw that Marshall Law cameo😏
BRUH WHAT?! BUT HOW WILL ZAY GET HER PANCAKES?
I actually yelled NO!!!!!!!!!! I scared the sh*t outta my cat
uh-oh zaida’s starting to break rule 3 🥴
"I know people are mad at the manager and I get it, it doesn't seem fair, but he kinda has a job to do. This isn't the first or second or third time this has happened. He's gotten constant complaints about him from guests. And he warned him about his attitude, too. I actually feel bad for the manager because he tried so hard to get him to act friendly BECAUSE he didn't want to fire him AND he wanted to be friends. Now, both those goals as tossed out the window...😥🥺"
"as pissed off as I am, he really is a crappy employee.... sorry,  not sorry."
"He needs to find a job that doesn’t involve customer service, but shit he got fired"
"Look, guys I know you don't want him to be fired but throughout the majority of the story he wasn't exactly giving good customer service. The customers weren't even that bad. If you ever worked in retail or with food, you know how some customers are. Given how Kade is, he should work where he doesn't have to interact with people directly or start a Patreon and do something productive online. Or even go to school so he can get a better job."
I love that Zay is so understanding about emotions even though she has little clue about earth stuff 😄 but I guess emotions are universal so I’m glad she’s there for him ❤️
sorry but bro... you can’t just openly be a terrible employee at work in a position where you’re easily replaceable... sad bc he need monies and we love him but not surprised lol
Zay talking like a cat with Cosmo is so damn cute. She's definitely a big sweetie and snug to hug. Hope kade gets a new job
Kade: *hugs Zay* Me: now kiss Kade: *gets fired* Me: no-
Rule 3 is on the edge of jumping out the window
Zay: I’m feeling a bit troubled  Me: same when I look at my bank account
Cosmo's knowing smile when Kade pulled Zay into that hug 😻😎
i feel bad but....yo he really did f up. you don't tell someone their interests suck and then not help them.  honestly impressed hes getting fired over something so real
i mean yeah... that usually  happens  when you don't  do your job.
"You guys are saying that Kade should not have been fired but he was pretty rude for a cashier. Frankly, the owner was wayyyyyy too nice to him. Kade literally insulted a customer and ignored them to be on his phone. If it was on the flip side where it was a story about the boss, most of you would dislike Kade for being lazy and annoying away customers."
"NO ONE IS GOING TO FREAKING MENTION FREAKING FALLING IN REVERSE? YALL FREAKING MISSING OUT, MY EMO CAN NOT BE MORE EMO!!!"
"THANK YOU. Hes a whole ass adult, you dont go ""bEiNG mE"" at work if it means doing a shit job. you can be genuine and still work appropriately. tbh I was waiting for this, too many stories have adults act w no sense in professional settings and get 0 consequences. idk what went through his head to make him think he can talk to anyone at work with a stank attitude and think its fine, ESPECIALLY if that job is retail (and to a client, wtf). so satisfying, thanks for keeping it real Pookie"
"On one hand, yea it sucks that he’s fired. On the other, that’s some bad customer service... seriously."
"Business wise, he did the right decision. Kade has already been rude on multiple occasions. He’s driving customers away."
how you gonna flat out give shitty customer service and then be surprised when you get fired 🤦‍♀️
"*creepy stranger shows up* HISSSSSSSSSSSSS *edit* Thank you for top comment! Make sure to like the episode and support the artist, her Instagram has more super cute art!"
DATE! 1ST DATE ALARM! RULE 3 BEGONE!
"""... Does Zay find mine cute?"" LOL 😍💕"
Is this dude gonna pull some corny ish like ‘cause her beauty is outta this world.’
"""CAUSE SHE'S TOO HOT TO BE HUMAN!!"" Bye simp"
Please just be a cosplayer fan please be a cosplayer fan please be a cosplayer fan
"“When I see female earthlings it reminds me of how strange I look”... same girl, same 👌"
Quick Zay use the force to mind control him!!!  May the 4th be with you!!!
We just gonna forget about rule 3 now?
"Listen, I love Kade just as much as Hades from Lore Olympus. But you had it coming! I’m sorry, love ya, but not the best employee"
CUZ SHES OUTTA THIS WORLD
shes a cosplayer 😳✊🏽✊🏽
"Hes asking about cosplay, HAS TO BE"
CODE RED CODE RED
"Also, can we just take a minute to appreciate the character developments of Kade and Zay? You're doing AMAZING with this Webtoon Pookie Senpai!!!"
Zays hips are a lethal weapon
"he's gonna drop a pick-up line, I can feel it.. ""cause she's 'out of this world' """
I need to forget about this app and come back in a year when it’s all free :-( the suspense is killing me AND my wallet.
Who does he think he is the government
Wow stranger danger WHILE rule #3 being was stomped on....
"Hi! The first week of hiatus was me trying to move into a new place as quickly as I could and while I got lots done I underestimated how tough it would be. I was super unprepared and even now I'm still adjusting. Some things went wrong trying to finish the next episode so I need another week to fix this mess. No worries, I will be back. 💕 I'm really glad everyone is enjoying it so much you wanna read more.✨"
"*insert tik tok sound* Aww shit... what the hell we gon do, now.😳"
Whoever dares ruin my ship will suffer the wrath of a crazy lonely manga reading 15 year old
"YES KADE, PROTECT YOUR ALIEN BAE 😍😆😆"
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that Zaida never got her pancakes 🥞
any one else want to kill him (for a second) after the comment on the ears and Zays face Edit: in () I missed that little bit
The fact that kade got so angry at the guy for making the alien bebe insecure is priceless 😤
Aww. She probably wanted the hoodie to cover her ears :(
Wait they get to go to arcade and not worry about COVID-19
Code Photo booth I repeat photo booth we all knwo wut happens in a PHOTO BOOTH.... kiss ppl kiss in them... at least they do in anime’s n comics :3
"why is everyone hating on Ethan, I think he's a smol bean who just thought she was Cosplaying. He didn't mean any harm. It's probably a normal reaction to think that."
"is this ""being ditched ""? 🦋"
“am i being ditched?” me everyday at school
I genuinely felt uncomfortable and bad for zay
He protecc  He attacc  But most importantly  He got Zay’s bacc
When Ethan made fun of Zaida and Kade got up hella quick to defend like a bf it’s a sign rule3 out the window for sure 😂💀
"Sooooo I’m curious, I wanna know who this guy is, he seems cool. Wow, congratulations me, I just stated the obvious"
Does anyone remember rule #3? Cuz' apparently Kade doesn't... Not that I'm complaining tho😉
Me: Ima save my coins for a long time.  This Comic: Im about to ruin this man’s whole career.
10 bux says they went into a photo booth
if anything happens to my alien baby hell's going to break lose
"I spent my five free coins I got, I'm happy I did"
I can relate to this kid
Me actually being born with elf like ears: yes b*tch it is normal
His name just HAD to be Ethan. It just HAD to be my name. Now I feel like I’m in the story being the weirdo asking who the alien is😑welp. Sorry Zaida. Ik your secret but I won’t tell
KISS IN THE BOOTH KISS IN THE BOOTH
Rule 3 just making a fool of itself right now (edit UHH wow I know I’m way late on this and it’s almost midnight but thank you so much for top comment I didn’t think this was even possible and kade come on rule 3 is dead it’s gone but you have a way to cope and she even floats
BOW CHICKA WOW WOW
I CAME HERE AT THE SPEED OF ‘PURCHASED’
*Slowly closes the curtain* I’ll come back another time...
I felt the second hand embarrassment
This chapter: exists  Rule 3: am I a joke to u?
c'mon Kade kiss the damn girl. please....
Is it just me or is this a classic misunderstanding that happens in almost all romance anime’s- harem god 😌🥺
*Gently puts the curtain back without entering*
Kades just living his best life
Well shit just went from 0 to 100 real fuckin quick
"My mans was like, ""if yall wanted to fuck... you coulda told that yall had other plans..."""
F in the chat for the nerd
"Remember guys, Rule 3 is just a fictional character. Obviously."
"can we talk about how good Kade is for her???? he like, tries so hard to try and make sure she will be ok, and the way he was like, u need to be confident made my heart actually melt 🥰🥰🥰"
Y’all he just ruined the moment they were having😭
Kade gonna have the nosebleed to end all nosebleeds 😂
HE NEEDS SOME MILK
IK I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE SCREAMING RN EEEEEEEEEEK YESS
Dude rule 3 just DOES NOT exist anymore lmao
Here lies rule 3 .    He had a short life and that is about it.
DAMN Kade already taking off her clothes... 😏 edit: thank you so much! I know this isn't top comment but I've literally never gotten this many likes before thank you! 😅
rule 3 said ight imma head out
Kade really said 😐🔪
Y’all see how he protected zadia rule 3 never heard of it
Biggest problem we gotta wait two weeks for the next episode
Nah bro she was just born in 1686 before gravity was discovered
"First of all RIP ALIEN BELIEVER’S BROTHER😞. But more importantly, can we trust you not to say sh!t? Also the way Kade went into full bodyguard mode was 👌"
"I feel for this guy.  Really.  He's chased the crazy dream of aliens his whole life, through happiness and tragedy.  Can anyone blame him for taking the chance when he saw it?"
"here's the thing. I don't think Ethan is a bad kid. It doesn't feel like he's blackmailing them or anything, since he could have brought the picture up in the cafe. Of course, I could be proven wrong on the next update. But to me, it doesn't feel like he has any malicious intent. He's a kid that spent years obsessing over space with his now deceased brother, now confronted with the possibility that he's witnessed an alien. I really want him to have the closer."
The way Kade steps in front of her is so cute
nah she just floats sometimes
"i don't think zay should be the one afraid, kade bout to murder this dude"
KADE IS SO PROTECTIVE OF HER 🥺 I love how much they’ve grown together since the start of the series
"Nah fam, she do magic"
Okay is it just me or was it the cutest thing when Kade pulled his hoodie strings and was all embarrassed
Ethan in the next ep. 🕺🕺⚰🕺🕺
PLOT TWIST HES ANOTHER ALIEN WHO ACTUALLY JUST WANTS ALIEN FRIENDS
THEY’VE BEEN FOUND OUT CODE RED CODE RED 🚨
"tbh i kinda like the alien obbsessed dude , he didnt even take some crazy risk and show everyone , but he actually took the footage out. i kinda trust him already even if its only been like three chapters"
He kinda acts entitled to the truth when it doesn’t really concern him..
WE'VE GOT A CODE RED I REPEAT A CODE RED🚨🚨
"Nah you're seeing things, she can just jump really high without looking like it. It's a special talent"
Goddamn it! You mean Ethan is part of the plot? 😫
“Is she an alien” I’d deadass be like “uh no?? Just a camera glitch or something lmao”
ight let's kill him
"I’m absolutely living for how protective/jealous Kade is getting. NO ROMANCE, MY ARSE!  Edit: Thanks for top comment, this is my favorite Webtoon :-) also I used the word “arse” bc I thought Webtoons would censor the word “ass” lmao leave me aloooone! xD"
"Kade thinking about making an amendment to that ""No Feelings"" Rule."
Is it just me or kade seems mad jealous😂
"I died when Ethan said ""So is sex the same?"" imma officially die of laughter🤣🤣🤣"
my guy seriously just had the audacity to say somthing so controversial then just leave them to suffer the awkward pain
"Anybody else like screaming at their phone like, “PLEASE JUST DATE.“"
BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW CUTE THEIR BABIES WOULD BE?!?!?!?! 😍😍
"I love how Kade is getting flustered about the lack of a romantic relationship! Don't worry buddy, I think it's coming!"
Kade rlly said 🔪😐 also rule three huh I didn't see it?
Who else noticed that Zaida was wearing a Melanie Martinez Shirt?!?!?🤩🤩🤩
Everytime she talks I can't stop hearing Starfire's voice.
So happy to see how much she cherishes the memories of them
Ethan was here asking some legitimate questions. Just hope he can keep his mouth shut for my girl Zadia.
"I think Kade might hook him up with a job at mallmart.  And I think they could end up building a,,, friendship of some kind.  The more he inquires about Zay,  the more Kade would get to know about her.  I like the idea of exploring their relationship and character development through another person's perspective"
Whenever she wants to know something abt him she can just grab him and put his forehead to hers ☺️
"Haha I’m gonna steal that, “your face is as red as pizza sauce”!!! 😂😂 Zay’s so cute and innocent"
is he gonna keep coming  back until  zaida and kade fall in love?????👁👄👁
inhales sO WhAt WErE U tALKing AboUt kADe
Ok so when are we getting the much needed backstory on Zadia
what if zaida is the princesse of zodia and she ran away beacaus she didn't want to marry someone ?
So are we just gonna ignore the fact that Zay put the middle finger up cause Kade did it 😂
He wasn’t calling you fat. Me: He was calling you THICC
Hey we all see that Melanie Martinez shirt 😂😂
Rule three??? Never heard of her
...this is what we get for reminding the author of rule 3 :(
*whispers* it’s about to be a...girl fight.
Im not gonna lie I started to choke up when she was looking at their photos and thinking of Rule 3. DONT WORRY BABY ILL MAKE SURE THE SHIP STILL SAILS
"dude, you don't dump your drink on someone and expect them to want to talk to you a few days later. MUCH LESS SHOW UP UNINVITED TO THEIR HOME."
"Sorry Ellie, this is the ship police. I'm gonna have to arrest you for trespassing on it 😤😤😤✋✋"
girl he said he wasn’t home🤡
DID HE JUST FKING REJECT HER
Rule Four: The exception to rule three is now null and void
"Everyone who’s wonderin who is the blonde girl, shes the girl that dumped kade from episode 1"
peeping Melanie Martinez in the first frame 👀 CRYBABIES ARISE!
"I feel like Ellie is going to think that they are dating and expose how Kade never enters a serious relationship. Bringing up more problems, drama, and probably a backstory"
patiently waiting for them to end up together....and for zay to get her pancakes
Ellie you piece of shit go away
Woman why the hell you even here. You broke it off and poured a drink on him. Leave LOL
"Yooo Kade, get over yourself, not explaining to Zay about sex could potentially endanger her in the future you douche! Awkward but you gotta to do it soz!"
BEGONE THOT!!! ONLY ZAYDAS ARE ALLOWED!
Welp I don’t think I can physically wait  for the next episode any longer so time to hibernate until a week from today
𝔽𝕀𝔾ℍ𝕋 𝔽𝕆ℝ 𝕐𝕆𝕌ℝ 𝕄𝔸ℕ.    (ง'̀-'́)ง
oop... I hope Ellie doesn't get too mad
we need Zays backstory
Well this is gonna be awkward
"Screw rule three, all my homies hate rule 3"
🎶 Hey there Delilah...
Y’all see that attitude she was giving zadia😱😤
Why the attitude though? Zay is obviously being genuinely friendly 😒
Man it's like people dont understand CONTEXT. From Ellie's perspective Zay is Kades new girlfriend. given that she just broke up with him not to long ago it looks really sketchy to her. understandably. like I get the attitude entirely.
Kade has the same hair style for more than 10 years that dedication
Red flag #4: Thicc af
Bet they broke up cuz she moved to New York City
THATS WHY HE WAS LISTENING TO HEY THERE DELILAH
"I know she’s misunderstanding Zaida and all but damn no need to be harsh girl, you barely know her"
I love she all hostile and Zay just scoots closer then she think she about to make zay uncomfortable by talking about her and kade and Zay like oh a Kade story Hell yea! Lol
CAN YOU NOT CALL MY BABY DIMWITTED
"Zaida just being completely innocent like ""do you enjoy pancakes?"""
"*over speakers:* Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. If you look to the right of the aircraft, you will notice a scheming ex. Please buckle your seatbelts because the fandom is not happy."
I think Zadia is about to get a nice plate of jealousy after his ex is done with her story
How do you get offered pancakes and still have an attitude?? 🥞 ❤️
Well your hair might not be pink but your face sure is
EVERYONE SHUT UP young cute kade is breathing 😤😤
Can someone tell Delilah to go back to new york city???
anyone else getting a b*tch vibe?
"OMG! do u guys remember near the beginning on their way towards the grocery store i think, the radio was playing hey there delilah?? FORESHADOWING!!!!!!"
I waited for 1 week and I read it in like 1 minute
Give respect to the people who started singing 🎶Hey there Delilah🎶like full on respect 😔✊
okay can we all just acknowledge small kade?
Hold on we not gonna act like we didn’t just hear her not talk about his kink😂
Why this is gonna be awkward when she finds out they're roommates not a couple ... yet
"honestly girl your fault the relationship didnt work 😅 you KNEW he needed time, you even suggested it and when he finally listens you go an ""wait, wait, what about meee!"" dont take advantage of peoples feelings when theyre in a low spot!"
"Ellie just doesn’t seem like a good friend and really Jealous plus petty, like I understood you were hurting but he made his choice in who he wanted and as much as you’re going to hate it, you will never be a choice he will go back to, I’m surprised he hasn’t kicked her out especially when she’s trying to bring up all old stuff I think that’s very disrespectful on a number of levels, she wants control I hope kade doesn’t fall for it"
I believe his kink is for collarbones.
i like how she gave her strawberry to her😂💀
"This just made Kades story even more depressing. Cuz like his life revolved around her since THIRD GRADE. And now out of nowhere, he just has to forget about her. And then you throw Zadia who looks like her into the mix of tears and loneliness"
"I actually don’t dislike Ellie’s character, she’s (was) just hopelessly in love with someone who doesn’t (didn’t) love her back, and that can be heartbreaking. However, kissing Kade after he’d just conceded to need a break was really unfair and inconsiderate of her as a true friend. She should’ve at least given him some time and space before making a move on him. There’s that."
"Okay so let me do the math. Assuming Kade and Delilah were both 16 years old when they got together and both graduated at 18. 5 years after high school, Kade must have been 23 when they broke up. And we know that he is now 24. So you mean to tell me they were together for 7-8 years!!!!! Broooo😭"
Holon how tf. U gon tell him to take a break from dating and you go kiss da boi
why would she kiss him and go into a relationship with him if she knew he was vulnerable????? i want to like ellie because i don’t know her that well but by what i do know she was pretty selfish and just wanted to be kades gf :/
Kade gettin like 5 girls and I still sit with 0
"I can see where it could have gotten toxic but you can also see there were genuine feels. Oof I feel for her. Both I guess? Obviously she wasn’t perfect after that, she just seems immature and insecure."
Zaida is such a sweetheart giving away her strawberry 🥺💗
but seriously she got with him at his most fragile and then gets pissy and dumps him humiliating him in public because hes having a hard time finding his emotions.... a real class act
"I like her, as a character. I don't like how she's treating Kade and Zaida though. but she's still a well written character"
"And this Kids, is why you practice communicating your feelings regularly with those you love rather than going radio silent and expecting others to do the heavy lifting!"
Is anyone else wondering what the kink is lol
"I really hope Zadia and Kade get together, forget about rule three"
"sO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. This girl tells him he shouldn’t date for awhile, and then when He finally listens to her, she goes and smooches him? Dang, I get the bad vibes from her 😂"
"Roses are red, Viloets are blue, Kade has a kink, And Zaida has no clue."
Ellie is so smug it's annoying. I get that she's friends with Kade but the way she shows up and starts having an immediate attitude with everything is just sickening. I feel like Kade needs to tell her to leave. It's none of her business who he's friends with or what he does. If she's so desperate to be friends again maybe she should try being nice.
I love the pic where zaida missed the mustache and then the second time where they nailed it :))
Zay is such a wholesome bean
"Love, Girl...Love. Yo first top comment Wut Wut!"
Is it weird that I like Ellie even more now??? It’s SO HARD to own you made a mistake and she owned several in quick succession. (also Zaida 🥺 pure soul)
His weird fetish is collarbones. IM CALLING IT
Zay is copying Kade and flipping a bird while looking confused in one of the photos AAAAAAH 😂 /edit this was my first top comment hi 🥺
Hahaha when is she gonna figure out their not dating and there roomates it's gonna be so awkward for her BAHAHA
aww i’m sorry but i can’t hate ellie 😭 i can at least respect her for realizing she took advantage of kades desperation. poor girl 💔. the heart wants what it wants
"Zay is bringing out the real Kade!! thought to be extinct he shall raise from the ashes, like a Phoenix!! and they shall be Zade!! lol 😍😍 loving it couldn't help myself but to spend some coins for this! keep it up!"
"It’s because with Zaida, there is no expectations or pretense. Kade just enjoys her presence and he doesn’t have to pretend to be anything else. He can just be himself and she doesn’t expect anything more from him. That’s beautiful!"
"ok, but Ellie thinks Zaida is his new girlfriend. Imagine how uncomfortable and weird this would be for a regular human girl who just started seeing this guy. she comes over is immediately shitty with her and talks about she was in love with him and cries and fights with him. Even if Ellie is being kind now, this would be a weird dick move if Zay was the human person she thinks she is."
zaida can make anyone smile like that girl. zaida is the purest ever
I love Zaida so much she is so sweet and pure. She is honestly amazing 😌❤❤❤
I CAME AT THE SPEED OF PURCHASED
"I think it's really important that she admitted to taking advantage of his desperation. People don't talk about how men get taken advantage of and they get out down if they try to bring it up themselves. Men's health issues really d matter, they bottle up so much and have so little socialization for emotional intelligence. This was an important chapter."
I can’t wait to see Kades face when he finally kisses Zaida 💚
Can we all just appreciate how beautiful the art style is for this series? :’)

I just noticed zay and kade flipping the camera off and zay looks so confused 😂😂
"""How'd you get him to smile like this?"" By breaking Rule 3, duh."
Ellie is not so bad after all. I like her. Rule 3 is shattering. (Edit: It took awhile for me to notice but tysm for my first top comment! :D)
I LOVE THE CHANGE THAT ZAY IS BRINGING TO KADE HE JUST SEEMS SO MUCH MORE HAPPY AND LIVELY
she's not that bad BUT KADE DONT GET DISTRACTED FROM OUR PRECIOUS ZAIDA 😭😭😭
I actually really love how they both admit they’re in the wrong. Kade using her to temporarily get rid of the pain. And Ellie using his mental state to be with him. It shows much maturity in both sides
zaida’s heart is almost as thicc as her thighs 🥺🥺
Ellie was legit like “You managed to make him show his teeth in a photo WHILE radiating joy. YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE
I love how the author didn't leave it with the girls hating each other. that trope seems to happen too often.. this was a way more mature and emotionally secure way to handle things ❤️
i love how zaida influences everyone she meets so positively
"CHARACTER 👏🏻 GROWTH 👏🏻 I’m so glad that Kade said no, it’s not okay to how he treated Ellie. It’s so easy to just say “hey, it’s fine, it’s okay” when someone treats you poorly, but then for that person to admit that it’s not okay, they were in the wrong, and apologize takes a lot of growth."
WE LOVE ELLIE NOW. AND KADE IS A K I N G FOR FINALLY OPENING UP AND BEING HONEST AND RESPECTFUL. THIS IS AMAZING
I hope there's a cute filler episode about Zaida learning to use a phone and take tons of pics of the kitty :)
Are we not talking about how kade still doesn’t have a job
I wanna know more about Zaida’s past!
That was so sweet! She shipped them💙
"It’s not always about how long you’ve known someone that makes them important or impactful in your life, it’s about the quality of what they bring, more time doesn’t always equal better, glad Kade is opening up from the influence of Zay :)"
"People are talking about Ellie not being that bad?? She's actually freaking awesome, the circumstances that led to their relationship was the problem. Glad Zay is having such a positive influence on Kade and now she has her first female human friend."
"I like that Ellie and Zaida want to be friends! There are lots of stories with really distructive female characters-which isn't that comon irl(not saying it doesn't happen tho), at least not when you're older. Everyone in this comic is so pretty, I admire the art style!❤🌺"
That would be a great threeso..... nvm
she blushes so much that her skin color is pink permanently. puts a whole new meaning to strawberry blonde. XD
How’s rule three doing kade😌
I regret nothing when I used my 10 coin😌
I will always spend my coins and money on this episode till the end xd
~you think I’m “really pretty”? ✨💖 THE SHIP IS SAILING PEOPLE :3~~ wowzz thanks for top comment ☺️
Rule 3 never had a chance haha  Edit: Thanks for all the love everyone!
YES ZAIDA YOU ARE MORE THAN PRETTY GIRL NOW KISS KISS FALL IN LOVE
Rule 3? F*ck that.
who else noticed Ethan's name tag said kade in one panel.. hehehe
"as soon as I saw that kade called her really pretty, y'all already KNOW I chocked on my Gatorade 😅"
(BLUSHING INTENSIFIES)
"Zay, we ALL think you’re really pretty 👏"
"""you think im really pretty?"" kade: Fuck..."
"I really wanna trust alien nerd boy, but my trust issues tho .... also..rule #3, byeee"
All aboard the Zay and Kade ship!
The prettiest alien in the entire universe 🥺🥺
I WASTED ALL MY 20 FREE COINS ON THIS AND I AINT MAD
Anyone else notice Ethan’s nametag said Kade for a second? Lol
rule 3 is fucked
"KADE WORKS AT WALLMART NOW?! *hops in car* get in,we’re going shopping-"
"Lmao  Kade: “I’m tryna teach you about earth and the nuances of people’s personalities and how they prefer personal gain over anything else—“  Zay: “Okay, but rewind to when you called me really pretty. That’s important.” more"
THIS IS MY FIRST FAST PASS AND YOU HAD TO ADD A CLIFFHANGER FOR FUC.K SAKE AKDBSK
"You ppl keep talking about rule three, I’ve literally never heard of her😌✨"
*casually uses all of my 20 free coins on this comic*
"ILLEGAL. That cliffhanger is absolutely, 100%, without a doubt, ILLEGAL.😭😭😭"
Vitiligo is super pretty. I never thought I’d see a character with it!
DONT BE SHY FINISH YOUR SENTENCE KADE
Kade's blush is everything 😍 and don't blame him that other girl is a cutie! Vitiligo is GORGEOUS. Too bad he's already got a cute alien girl at home innocently chipping away at rule 3 🤷🏻‍♀️
"Whilst I completely love this new blue haired character, and I think it is so beautiful that she has vitiligo, she better not get in the way of my Kade x Zay ship"
"Honestly I stopped to stare too, she's so gorgeous 🥺"
kade said 😳 ----> (○｀д´)ﾉ 🦋
hehe rule three is dissolving like the goldfish in fish dissolving solution
There’s only one thing he should be smashing and it isn’t butterflies!!
You know what comes after two? Four. Because three doesn’t exist here.
"Okay, so I like that Zay and Kade have strong chemistry, but I also like that it's not a *fall in love at first sight* kind of story. I mean, we know about his ex...kinda, but what about Zay? She mentioned someone from her home that wanted to make her leave I think. They both have their scars. It would be too awkward to have them suddenly have these feelings and have a spur of the moment kiss, but then not know how they feel after. They gotta work out their own feelings first."
It’s nice to see a character with my skin condition in manga you don’t really see people with it makes me feel special🥺
The greatest telepathy moment will be when they kiss!!!!! OOOOOHHHHH I CANT WAIT!!!
A romantic rival appears 😭 and she's so pretty
seeing kade smash the butterfly was a big mood i love it
"A Vitiligo character..... I like it!! plus she's pretty and seems nice, bruh and she savage.... CAN WE KEEP HER AROUND?"
"Alright let’s just get this out there. Ladies. If you catch a guy looking at you, there are two(possibly more) reasons. 1. He’s checking you out to see if he might have a shot with you in any way. 2. Well this one goes unsaid as it’s the same for most guys. He’s fantasizing. Fantasies of either intimate, or he longs to protect you and cherish you. Guys. Everyone know it can be difficult to not stare when a fine young lady catches your eye. Just go say hi.Maybe introduce yourself if you’re new..."
"Cool new girl, dont get in the way tho"
how is he a pervert if all he looked at is her face
"Kayde, you have A QUEEN AT YOUR HOME, DO NOT FORGET IT"
"I hope this girl becomes a re-occuring character, I mean, she's far too detailed not be...right."
"why is nobody mentioning how Kade and that ""Yeah you too, or whatever."" guy need to become bro's? they'd be perfect for each other"
Fast pass gang
She's an alien...and she's playing Ocarina of Time...DUDE JUST MARRY HER ALREADY
I mean...those thighs do be lookin good
zaida waking up kade so hes not late for work is so cute🥺
"""The temptation to grab her thighs is growing at an alarming rate!"" That freaking killed me🤣🤣🤣"
Rule 3 is currently being smothered by Zaida’s thighs 😂
Rule #3 I don’t know her
👀 getting in each other's head when you want to get in each other's be- 🛏
"I hoping he sees how much she wants wants physical closeness with him, and then she sees how much he is attracted to her and bam, kiss!!"
uhoh... telepathy our girl might see alot of xxx thoughts if this goes on... or she might see something aka another girl dont break my girls heart
if only I could fast pass a fast pass
"shalalalalala my oh my, looks like the boy's too shy, not gonna touch the thigh !!"
Gamer Girl Zay is so adorbs!
"I can't take the suspense anymore!!!!! I want touching, and kissing, and I want it Now!!!!"
"Zay reaches into his mind... and all she sees is ""Must touch the thiccness, must touch must touch must touch"""
"Pookie, seriously, your character writing is phenomenal! Kade and Zay are so well crafted. They're interactions are really fun to read every week and I find myself coming back to re-read just to smile and laugh with them. You rock at this! 😁"
stop blue balling us it's been 33 episodes
Yes....feed her kade.....Make our ship grow stronger
Every episode imagining them as a couple gets better and better
I too would like to grab the forbidden thighs
Alien Thighs Save Lives 👉👈
use ur telepathy to read his mind. reads mind... DAMN SHE THICC
fast pass gang
his little rule just went right out the window . they are gonna soooooo Do it ! Dow chicka wow wow !
she's on his lap. . . this will be a problem edit: a problem as in I am not sure he will be able to handle it and it might move too fast for her for anyone wondering :) B
LAP SITTING!!! AHHHHHHHH!!!!
They are so freaking cute!!! 🥰🥰
too many excuses just read his dirty mind😏👀 this many likes wow thank u cepedawetta on yt.
Kade! Finding her attractive doesn’t make you a pervert! She fine!
"ALERT ALERT: CODE RED!!! SHE'S ON HIS LAP! THIS IS NOT A DRILL, I REPEAT THIS IS NOT A DRILL!!!"
*knock knock* this is the police were looking for a missing person case. The person answers to the name of Rule 3.
He's not a perv he's just slowly but surely realizing his possible feelings for her
Admiring women is not perverted
he's boned
I knew it. I knew she wouldn’t let it happen this episode. It still hurt when it ended. Time to sleep till next week
Well kids you see it all started when me and your mom broke rule three

Kade: keep a blank mind.....blank Zay: * casually sits on his lap. Kade exe. has stopped working.
At this moment he knew he f***** up
This Webtoon got me smiling on the toilet
*inhale* WHEN. WILL. WE GET. A HALF ALIEN. CHILD.
I never spent a 5 coins so quick in my life...
Chapters are getting shorter than normal may want to consider a break if your getting worn out I prefer long chapters than short ones and I don’t want to stress you out on making a request that will just burn you out
YOU BET YOUR ASS I BOUGHT FAST PASS AND IMMA BOUT TO DO IT AGAIN
"Also, Kade, YOU ARE NOT A PERVERT. It's normal to have feelings you know. It may feel different now because it's actually love and not just dating around."
Where I fits I sits.
She knows what she’s doing 😏
its official rule three is no more ladys and gentlemen
Feel like this will end... poorly.
"Hi! Creator here. I love you guys so much. Thanks for fast passing and such. :3 Means so much to me that you're enjoying the series so much that you just can't wait. I hate to drop this bad news on you now of all episodes. lol... but, there's no fast pass this week. It will return again next week! I've been having a hard time keeping up and it caught up with me. Sorry again! I hope you still look forward to next week. 💕"
"Kade: I want to be kind and respectful to her, too. Also Kade:  I’mma bite this girl. 😱🤷🏼‍♀️🙃"
He’s trying so hard but he’s so horny omg
Plot twist he’s a vampire
Watch this just be all in his mind and she can see ittttttt
will zayda see kade as a pervert? will kade still see zayda as a friend? will Cosmo ever make zayda pancakes?.... tune in next Monday august the 31st to find out...
Say it with me guys! ✨CONSENT IS SEXY✨
CONSENT MAN! YOU NEED CONSENT!!
"I have a sneaking suspicion that this last bit is just what zay sees inside kade's head, rather than it actually happening. real or not Kade is seven shades of screwed."
"I am conflicted. I really want Kade to make a move and break the rule himself. We already know Zay likes him as well. But also this may scare her. She's never experienced these things before. I don't want her to feel unsafe, especially not with Kade."
Next ep he’s gonna be like no on second thought I won’t 😐
"HELP, KADE'S RESOLVE HAS FALLEN AND IT CAN'T GET UP!"
She probably going to come back scared because for some reason he trying to eat her 😂
c h o m p
AHHHHHHHHHHH y am I turned on
Zay: Kade what’s that hard object in your pants?
"Hello, police? I’d like to report an illegal cliffhanger! My heeeeeeart!!"
BYE BYE RULE 3
rule three just lookin at Kade like: 👋👁👄👁 do you need a snack?
"Lawd, everyone has a crush on our lil space bean xD"
That's Kades old boss oh no we in a pickle now
dammm he really backed out
"now here is where the jealousy begins, y’all ready? buckle up."
Ahhhh a new challenger approaches! Kade better get his girl before someone else does 😭
ooh i lowkey didnt expect Kade's old boss to make a reappearance lol
Anyone notice the plushes face when she bumped into him???  🤣🤣🤣
Kade🤬🔪 is typing....
Why do I feel like that guy has a crush on Kade
kade about to get rehired
ruh roh raggy
I’m actually glad he backed out. She still doesn’t understand human affection and intimacy; plus she doesn’t know how to read or write.... it’s best she is her own person and maybe she’ll want these things from him or not.
"I knew my boy Kade would be able to stop and compose himself, but damn.. I was really hoping to see em kiss just a little! (Ok thats a lie I wanna see em kiss ALOT!)"
Ima need him to bibbity bobbity back the fuxk up🙂
REVERSE HAREM. Zaida get all the mens
"""A NEW CHALLENGER HAS APPEARED"""
"SLAP ME ACROSS THE FACE WIHT A FANCY PANCAKE RIGHT NOW, OF FREAKING C O U R S E HE'S IN LOVE WITH HER (honestly who isnt tho)"
GOOD JOB KADE!!! you didn't break rule three...................................................................................................yet........................
Who else was worried last week when the fast pass didn't come out? 😰
it finally came out and now I have to wait again... hmp welp... 😕🙃
OMG that’s was such a tease...... (still love it tho)
"I have some theories first she wouldn’t get with boss man because remember the story surrounds kade and if kade isn’t in the picture anymore there will be no need for this story to continue, second Zay is not ready to date anyone besides kade because she has been around him the longest, third she’s fallen for kade already, fourth kade denied friendship with his boss so of course Zay is going to follow Kade cause she trust him."
That was the fastest toss into the friend zone  if I ever read one. 😂😂 still on the kade ship though!!
Ok it only better be for modeling or else I’m coming in with my space laser
DAMN IT KADE JUST ASK 👏HER 👏OUT👏
Kade: she's my-😏 Zaida: friend!😁 Kade: hello darkness my old friend...😔
I hate reading these so fast :( because now I gotta wait longer
"you know... I've read quite a lot of webtoons, and I have to say the scariest thing I've seen is other readers. at the first sign of something wrong it's a damn bloodbath brewing in the comments."
Kade went into “false boyfriend mode”
I swear. She better not end up dating him or I will gut him so fast he won’t know what hit him
I thought it was a marriage proposal
OMGG WHEN KADE HUGED ZAY AND SAID SHES MY-  AND THEN ZAY SAID FRIEND BUT HE PROBABLY WAS GONAN SAY GIRLFRIEND🥺❤️
OOP I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA ASK HER OUT
"I dont care what the bank account looks like, I will continue to spend inappropriate amounts of money on coins for this."
Was not expecting that.
He was gonna ask her out. THANK THE LORD Kade stepped in. Kaida forever
So worth the five free coins I just redeemed two seconds ago
PROTECT YOUR GIRL KADE YOU GO!!! BE ALPHA MALE!! Also rip get friendzoned nerd
NOT THE DIRECTION I WAS THINKIN
WHY WONT KADE JUST KISS HER ALREADY 😭😭😭😭
Kade was about to say his ✨𝐺𝚤𝑟𝑙𝑓𝑟𝚤𝑒𝑛𝑑✨
I lost it when he said Katherine 💀
(my mom) hey you got a notification (Me) whats it from (my mom) somthing called down to er- (me) sorry this is import
"OH NO! Stace is tryin to get to Zay through Kade!! Don't do it, he's bamboozling you, it's a SHAM I say, a SHAM!!!!!!"
HES GONNA ASK FOR ZAIDA TO MODEL FOR KADES OLD JOB BACK AHHH... wheres my blanket im gonna reread the whole series too good to stop 🤣
I got a bad feeling about this proposition 😂😂
OMG HE GAVE HER THE HEAD PATS!! SO CUTE!!!
stace gives off brat energy and i live for it
"Kade, even if she models, she's coming home with you."
stace do be kinda cute tho ngl
He...he- ... HEAD PAT!!! HE DID THE HEAD PAT TO OUR BEAUTIFUL ZAY !!!!  BIG THINGS ARE IN STORE FOR US BOYS AND GIRLS!!!
Stace is simpin during no simp September.  not to mention he’s shady af 😤
I like how Stace always teases Kade like poking a bear with a stick.
Anyone else notice how Stace repeatedly gives Kade these weirdly seductive looks 😂
Why does it feel like everyone in this is an absolute weirdo? Like Zay has an excuse and Kade I guess just wants to protect his future wife but everyone else is so creepy at times.
So we not gon talk about how this girl fr was crushing on kade stalking him on his shifts wtf
Stace sus vote him out
I have a proposition for you Stace 👌
yo if he works at spenders then he can monitor her while she's modelling
He’s totally trying to get zaida to do the modeling thing😂
OH SNAP I think we allll know what that proposition is...
This man super sus
"to the person disliking every comment, your moms a hoe"
"I was pretty cool with Stace when the story began, but now he's giving off some seriously sleezy vibes. I hate it."
I’m still kinda flustered that kade never took a bite 😂😂😂😂🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️👀👀
"OKAY BUT CAN WE APPRECIATE ZAIDA IN PIGTAILS ITS THE CUTEST THING AHHHH💕💕💕💕💕 Edit: Thank you guys sm omg!!! this is my first time getting top comment and it makes me so happy to get it on my favorite webtoon, ily all😭💕"
"Rule One of any comic: anything and everything will ruin the moment. Good luck, Pervert! EDIT: There is a lot of debate going on for a joke in the comment section of a comic. 🧐"
So happy for Kade! It makes such a difference when you like your job
"Im gonna agree with Kade, this arrangement seems Sus as hell.... vote his old boss off the ship. 🤔🤔🤔"
He better not catch feeling for her that only for  our alien queen
Uh-oh... do I smell a love triangle???   Well... I guess it's more like a square
"I know this comment will got lost in the crowd, but I really love how you included a character with  Vitiligo!! I've never seen anyone else do it and it super cool!!!"
No new ships 😤😤🚫🚢
The boss man is in love with Kade Im calling it now
"Just imagine if kade chose that girl over zaida, there I am, in front of his house at 3 am, holding a sledgehammer 😊"
Sorry girl but Zaida has already...abducted his heart *wink wink*
Idk the manager gives me the vibes that its not Zaida he’s into...👀
Did he invite him back because he thinks Kade and that girl will hit it off and then he can get closer to Zay?!? HE’S SUS AF
When you’re so early that not even the “First” people are here
Nope other cute girl you have to go. The ship is sailing and we aren’t taking any other passengers.
at this moment he knew he f*cked up
Nothing could ruin this day- “Pervert?” Well shit never mind
Does anybody else read zaida lines in starfires voice?
I love how she greeted him as pervert. jk it kinda pissed me off
I couldn’t stop my hand from pressing fast pass😓
Oh no I don’t like where this is going kade is meant for zay and no one els!!!
"The girl is a bit... idk, rude?"
CAN WE OFFICIALLY SHIP ZADIA AND KADE!!!!!!!😭😍
"Working in retail, that stunt would've pissed me off. Couldn't she just make small talk? Nope. She decided it was a big brain move to get those shirts."
THE WAY ZAIDA LIT UP WHEN KADE CAME HOME AHHHH THEY'RE TOO CUTE
"Kade deserves a break, but honestly this is just the karma for all the wrongs he's pulled. I love that he's come a long way since before Zaida came but the poor guys gonna have to deal with a lot more than a snarky co worker and boss 😔 Also, Cosmo the real MVP of this webtoon💕 (Edit: let me emphasize on how my comment its strictly opinion based and is just my own personal view, a lot of you are also misinterpreting what I'm saying anyways so feel free to ignore my comment and move along please more"
"everyone's talking about how what the new girl did was ""funny"" but it wasnt cool. what she did, even if it was her trying to break the ice or whatever, kade didnt see it that way. he saw it as her basically trying to get rid of him. as someone who also has difficulty socializing and being insecure i wouldve felt the same way"
She is getting so good at drawing so quickly...maybe Zadia is drawing the comic and we are all just fools?
Why is the most unbelievable thing about this story is that Kade is able to own/rent a house on a retail workers salary?
That was pretty fucking rude of her. I feel SO bad for Kade.
"Anyone else have the feeling that the girl with vitiligo was just trying to kid around with Kade and lighten up the mood, but then it backfired big time? Everyone else here is saying she was a bitch, but I've been in a misunderstanding kind of situation like this before. Edit: I understand that her actions could seem asshole-ish to him or some people, that's not the point. What I was saying is that it could be that she was trying to joke and then it got misunderstood."
the way zaida glowed and was so happy when he came back home 😭😭💘💘
"okay something I've noticed about the new girl, she may possibly have vitiligo ( a condition that causes discoloration to the skin) so she is probably used to people giving her all kinds of weird looks so she lashed out at kade in retaliation and probably felt bad but she's super awkward and everything she does only makes it worse. i'm not gonna be too quick to judge cuz we have only seen one pov to the story. i still don't like what she did with the shirts tho that was a dick move"
This new girl is making kade feel some type of way and plus the manager I don’t like it
Anyone else always imagine zaida with star fires voice?
In next chapter plsss hug him we all know he needs it
"Honestly, if some bitch did that to me at work, I would’ve been like “...It’s your mess, so clean it up your damn self.”"
20 bucks that girl likes him and is an aggressive flirt
Does kade and zay even have feelings for each other at this point?
I feel like that new girl is gonna get in the way of the ship
i have been forever cursed. this is my first webtoon story i'm reading and it's one of those ones that's so good that everything else is bad in comparison and i just want nothing else but this. does that happen to anybody else or am i just a weirdass?
I wanted to like Suzy because we both have vitiligo but after the stunt she just pulled... we’d be fighting
how dare she hurt Kade? 🥺 poor baby
"Regardless of whether Kade ""had it coming"", this girl (Suzy?) doesn’t know his history. She is judging him based off that one interaction at Walmart, and her response to him staring suggests she has her own issues and coping techniques. She's not terrible but that was still a dick move. I never did stuff like that even to coworkers who were frequently awful to me, it’s called being professional."
The power of....... FRIENDSHIP!🥰
"Also, thigh-pillow for the win! Zaida's surely seem to be some 10/10 thicc thighs. Gosh, I'm jealous!"
"Why are they so adorable, like I aspire"
Bro Code: True Rule Number 1: Always help a Bro in Need.
"Not gonna lie... I thought Ethan was a suspicious character. But, I have to admit the way this friendship chemistry is developing between these three melts my heart. That was really cool of Ethan to help lift Kade's spirits. Zaida's concern for Kade and the joy she exuded once it was clear Kade was feeling better was so sweet! It's gonna be so satisfying when those two finally get together."
Theyre so cute together! Slowly but surely helll realize he's falling for her and that she can provide the good in his life. Those Glowing Galaxy eyes :D
This is some wholesome stuff I think all of us reading need right now.
"I love how Zaida’s just hiding on the ledge as Pikachu while Kade and Ethan go for hardcore edgeguards, it feels really in character."
"I'm a grown-ass man kicking my feet in the air, fan-girling about a manga couple, and I'm PROUD OF IT"
I couldn’t help but smile at him and kade bonding
Boy just needs some thicc thigh therapy
I wonder...when is Zaida getting her ear rings
I know this is pretty random but I wonder why the author hasn’t gone into detail over her past in her home planet? I wanna see flashbacks memories etc!
when.. the... hell ... are... they... gonna... kiss??°°
"dam, she does actually care for him, but yet he is still so blind."
im lowkey upset with Ethan for ruining their moment but at the same time im glad he showed up so Kade knows he has more than just one person who he can confide in and feel comfortable around 🥰
"Kade, where is rule 3?"
AWWW HOW HAPPY SHE GOT WHEN SHE SAW KADE SMILING 👏👏
Such a wholesome episode! I love it so much.
"Where is rule 3, I can’t find it anywhere."
Zay's hand on Kade's chest as he lays there and talks to her 😭😭❤❤❤❤
Thick thighs save lives
"Am i the only one that buys like 100000000 episodes then realizes: ""Wait I have to wait 21 days for the next episodddeeeee!?!?!?"""
This girl has no boundaries
"I feel so bad for Kade. All he wants to do is have his old job back and make some money, but that girl and his boss are being super annoying."
Kade finna snap y’all I can feel it
"My trust issues arent allowing me to trust any character other than Zay, Kade, Ethan and Cosmo right now. I'm voting this coworker chick she's sus as hell😤"
"Kade, my dude, this girl likes you. She’s tryin to flirt but she’s got no game... and per usual you’re oblivious. 😂"
"if she's trying to make friends she is doing a horrible job at it. Do you think insulting him is gonna make him like you? Newsflash it isn't, I said in the last episode I wouldn't be so quick to judge and that still stands. However, im really not liking her attitude. Perhaps this is genuinely her idea of flirting but it is heavily flawed. insulting his work, body, and calling him a pervert all the time isn't cute. Get it together girl-"
"Ugh. Sometimes you just don’t wanna be social. I feel for him, dude."
Zaida is the best kind of recharge. good for the beginning of a healthy relationship. I love it
"People often think that this kinda thing can only happen to girls...but men can experience this kinda shit too. also for showing Kade suffering with his mental health and anxiety when it's such an unspoken subject with males, they have the rehtoric of man up, grow some balls, guys don't cry...I feel for Kade I just want Zay to give him a cuddle ❤️"
"Nah, I totally see where this is going, that girl really is just trying to be friendly, she’s being sarcastic but it’s not in a bad way, the problem is that he got a bad first impression, and she’s bad at reading social cues. Homegirl isn’t in the wrong, but she needs to read the mood and lay off."
"My boy is literally what every introvert is when they have to work in retail, or are in a new situation with someone they don’t know and I feel for him"
I feel like if this continues there’s going to have to be a gore warning on the next episode cuz Kade is going to kill someone
let my guy have some personal space.
i kinda want zay to meet the girl and see how she treats kade and then she can go off on the girl and kade likes zay even more but that’s just me.... 👉👈
Bro when Zay comforts Kade it’s the cutest thing ever lol
"Smh... I'm as abrasive as this chick is, extremely socially awkward, so my ice breakers usually start with work teasing. Smh... I'M HER 😰 I apologize to anyone who I may have offended, I just suck at socializing and I often overthink what I'm going to say then blurt out the first thing that comes to mind... This makes me feel bad. I gotta work on my socializing..."
"This girl is so emotionally unaware it's incredible. She made Kade feel shameful the first time they met and he feels guilty when he's around her now. Because of this, all her teasing is even more offensive to him. Plus who thinks that making fun of people is how you make friends?? Once there is a connection, then there can be banter. Unfortunately, Kade has lowish self esteem also, but that's why Zaidia is the better fit. He gets a boost from  Zaidias warm, encouraging personality."
Zaida out here giving healthy relationships vibes🙌🏽
Bruh when his boss was like “I’ll join you” kade went from 😖 to😐
ummmm in what world was she kidding the first time?? you called him a pervert straight faced and walked away?? you just feel bad for being rude for no reason dafuq :!
"Girl: Pervert- Fandom: SHUT UP, BITCH!"
"People are trying to excuse her actions, when they shouldn't be. Her ""apology"" was weak, and saying ""guys are so sensitive"" beforehand undervalues the entire apology itself. It's obvious he's uncomfortable, and she's not helping matters. She's not coming off as ""weird or awkward,"" she's being rude and inconsiderate, especially seeing as they don't know each other AT ALL. Please stop trying to excuse her behavior when it shouldn't be excused. Making jokes at other people's expense isn't okay."
WHEN HE SAYS CLEAR MY HEAD HE MEANS ALONE
kade character development 🥺🥺
Darn I wanted to see their reaction after they got called a couple ;(
HES GROWING OUT OF HIS SHELL OMG THIS IS WHAT WEVE BEEN WAITING FOR!
When you make a conscious effort to see the good in your situation 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 we Stan emotional development and building healthy relationships that don’t only center around romance
Am I sensing a thing called “Bromance”?
"Some people will think this is just a filler episode, but this is important for the storyline as it will probably lead to what we are all waiting for."
The boss seemed like a jerk at first but I have come to see that this could be a cute friendship!!!
i miss zaida already😢
Anyone want Kade and Zaida to become a couple
"I’m so proud of you Kade, now go home to your wifeeee 😂💕🥺"
I’m the only one who thinks that the manager is gay ?
"Kade demonstrated how programmed we are to complain but when you stop to really consider things, a lot of days aren't that bad."
The real question here is... who ended up paying?
He’s figuring stuff out🥺
Aww such a cute couple had me dying😂😂😂😂😂
I was holding out hope rule 3 dies in this but no it survived another week
Conspiracy theory: what if stace is actually gay and wants to get closer to kade?
I want to see Kade and Zadia kiss!
Could Stace be... BISEXUAL!? 😱
Am i the the only one who just brought 100 coins just for this series.
oh no... kade x his boss is an ilegal ship! nonono NO! remeber guys! we ship KADE X ZAY...NO KADE X HIS BOSS! >:V
Not me dropping everything for a new episode 😳
These bands sound... familiar?.. no couldnt be
The name Twenty Two Co Pilots took me outtttt😭😭😭
"Gurlll that Spenders chick is trying to grab ya man, Zay 😱 Edit: ""Why are you booing me?  I'm right."""
Ethan: are you guys dating? Kade: No. Fans: ignore Kade he's talking crazy right now.
INDIRECT KISS!!!!!! And my mans Ethan the only dude who really knows what’s going on!! SHIP THEM FOR US ETHAN!!!
awwww the alien queen is jelly :(
Awww kade is finding all these new people/potential friends that he’s making and can talk with and and zay probably wants to explore and make some new friends too but she’s stuck in the house all day 🥺
i know Zaida and Kade are gonna date eventually but i hope they stay wholesome best friends for a little while longer. Kade has gotten MASSIVE character development but I think its a little bit to early for him to go back to dating for now atleast and Zaida i think has a lot more she needs to learn about Earth and herself in general before she gets a boyfriend
aww baby Zay Zay 🥺🥺 don't make your baby feel jelly also I'm so happy Kade & Ethan are so close now! I knew they're become great friends eventually ❤️
"“sTOp tHaT” Kade, search your feelings, you know it to be true."
"I know where this is going she isn't about Stacy, not yet anyway, she's envious that Kade is having fun at work while she's alone at home."
"Stab the Veil is my favorite band, others I love include The Angel Wears Prada, Sleeping Without Sirens, De-crown the Empire, All Time High,  Sworn Out, Don’t Dance Gavin, Hawthorne Highs, My Alchemical Romance, and Thy Art is Killer 😍😍"
I love that Zay isn’t bogged down with learned societal norms like buried emotions. She speaks exactly how she feels and there’s been very few miscommunications because of this! Well.. except for Kade’s “Precious Child” 😂
is it just me or does she sound like starfire ?(her voice in my head)
Me reading these band names like their JoJo Crunchyroll subs
"Rule 3? Haha, never met him"
YES. COMMUNICATION. THANK YOU ZAY FOR ACTUALLY COMMUNICATING YOUR EMOTIONS! THIS IS HOW GOOD RELATIONSHIPS ARE FORMED!
THE WAY I GOT ON MY PHONE WITH QUICKNESS KNOWING THERE WAS A FAST PASS UPDATE TONIGHT
I think she feeling lonely :<
They just had an indirect kiss.....(☞ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)☞
wow the creator has great taste
is anyone scared that kade will pick the new girl 😥
Brooo i feel soo bad bad for zay
Rule three? Don’t know her
I LOVED THIS CHAPTER! The development of their relationship is just so beautiful and the fact that they were able to communicate made me so happy it definitely shows growth and I love how healthy there relationship is!
I’m glad they’re communicating 😁
the fact that he tries for her i canttt. they need to end up together alreadyy🥺
Ok but like can we please appreciate how pretty the art is? Like sis I’m obsessed
my FBI agent is getting so many free comics right now because of me.
I cant believe he knew his real name this entire webtoon 🥴
They need a phone too flirt with each otherrrrrrrrrr 🥺
Kade's willing to go above and beyond to make Zay happy! Why don't they just confess their love already??
"He said ""uhuh we aint sleeping"" and my mind instantly went to the wrong place like boiiii dont give me a heart attack like that"
Okay i hope its not just me but everytime i hear Zaida speak in my head i hear Starfire from TeenTitans
I was wondering what homegirl was doing all day at home lmaoo like heavy quarantine vibes
"rule 3.... rule 3 going once..., twice...., and right out the window it goes. never to be seen or heard from again."
"I've got my eye on you Kade's manager, you havent redeemed yourself enough for me to use your actual name😤 Kade, protect our precious alien girl🥺💚"
JUST KISS HER! HUG HER! HOLD HER!
Something doesn’t feel right with the manager
I feel that the manager is homosexual
it's so hard being patient this is my favorite  webtoon
WAIT IF SHE PRESSES HER HEAD AGAINST THE CAT WILL SHE KNOW HOW TO SPEAK CAT?!?? WE NEED ANSWERS NOW
You can fly... that hit me in a different way..
PLEASE HES SO WORRIED FOR HIS BAE 😩😩😩😩😩😩🤌🏽‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
Okay like kade has to be the best guy on the planet I’m a guy reading this and I’m like damn I need to take notes
Mans gon get her the iPhone 12 pro
"THAT IS NOT YOUR SEAT, SIR!"
Boy better be moving over a seat or he'll be catching these hands!!!
Zaida your boo wants to hold your hand! come on girl 🤦‍♀️
Kade about to be ✨S A L T Y✨
BOY IF YOU DONT-
homeboy better move before i stick my sword where the sun dont shine
"The lion, the witch, and the audacity of this b#*&@"
Bro we all know Kade bout to be jealous af
better get tf up before u get slapped tf up
“you’re not literally glowing zaida”😂
the way she speaks reminds me of starfire it’s adorable
Hun....your butt is in Kade’s seat.
Next episode Kade will be just a tad bit of this word called ✨S A L T Y✨
omg I would have slapped that dude back to spencer's smh kade freaking invited you and you gonna do this wtf I just wasted ten coins that I got for free to be left on a cliffhanger I might steal someone's credit card for this stuff smh
I swear to god if this man doesn't disappear imma ask Thanos for a favor
As much as I dislike this mans he got skill
Also anyone else think they should make this into a animated mini series
I'm reading a lot of comments about Kade being too possessive and over protective and I'm sitting here like bro SHE'S AN ALIEN and FLEW in a WALMART cause she got EXCITED over a PLUSHIE! THE CONSEQUENCES OF HER BEING FOUND OUT BRINGS DEATH AND UTTER DESTRUCTION!!! You think she's bored and sad now. Wait until she's caged up and murdered for science. But that's just me
Does anyone else read her voice in starfire’s voice?
what?! no popcorn? its zays first movie though! 🥺
these are too damn short...
wrong seat get away STRANGER !!!
STAY WITH ME ❤️ can’t wait to see where this goes! *edit* you guys are the greatest! My first ever top comment ❤️
"""please stay with me"" JSJKEMFKCLEÑCNSMLF that made my heart reeeeally happy 🙀🎉♥️"
I don't think it's just that he likes Zaida. it seems like he also has social anxiety. he's really putting himself out there by making friends and going out. he's definitely been burnt by people in the past and it really seems like he's afraid that he'll slowly be pushed out of the group or he feels like he doesn't fit in. he seems like he pushes people away before they can hurt him
Rule 3 is going night night
Kade is so soft I can’t
YOU CAN TAKE  THAT RULE THREE AND THROW IT RIGHT IN THE TRASH!! Ahahah 😍❤️Also Ethan is the true protector we all need
*Rule 3 has left the chat*
He discarded rule 3 like Anakin discarded the younglings
"""Stay with me"" And the hearts of the Fandom melted"
"Ok that was a really good ending to this chapter, (aside from the cliffhanger) it was adorable. But can we just talk about how much of a bro Ethan is?"
I wish to fast pass a fast pass 🥺👉👈
Is someone jealous? 👀😏
what was the rule again i forgot
I kinda want her to accidentally hear his thoughts.  Like they bump heads or something. That man's in love.
"🎵Oh won't you... staay with meee, cause you're... all I neeeed🎵"
My heart cant take this omfg
DANGIT POOKIE! I WANT HIM TO PULL HER CLOSE AND HOLD HER TIGHT AND SHARE HIS TRUE FEELINGS CUZ WE ALL KNO HES IN LOVE! WITH ZAY! NO MO HOLDIN BACK KADE!
"Zaida: all the current people I consider friends are males and I care for all my friends! Kade: Hey... remember the no dating rule? Let’s toss that out the window ok, no other dude can have you"
"good episode, you can tell he truly cares about her. looking forward to the next episode!"
Kade’s evolution from cold hearted meanie to Zay’s very dramatic and emotional bodyguard  is precious 🥺
does anyone else hear Starfires voice when she talks?
I refuse to wait another week
He’s so deep in the “friend zone “ that she doesn’t realize romantic feelings yet
"I honestly liked the rain scene, but I needed to see a kiss."
“I’m still stranger status” I feel that on a personal level
OMG! such a heartwarming chapter... And it's a good thing Stace remains as a stranger. We don't want any meddlers getting between Kade and Zai🔪💀
now kith kith. I SAID KITH KITH. 🔫🔫 DO IT
These two oblivious beings don't know how hard they are catching feelings... THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW. 😨
Lmao she feels troubled bc she has feelings & he told her not to catch them. A mess😭
"I don’t think it’s “friendzone” per say. She likes him, she just doesn’t know how to explain it, so she calls it friend"
"He needs to buy her a phone soon, because once she has it I bet she won't stop texting him 😁😁"
"she still learning how to be an earthling, she doesn’t really understand romantic feelings.  i think it’s cool that they’re taking things slow cause how can she consent to things that she doesn’t understand. she’s pretty much a child learning her first steps. everything takes time"
Add “boy” to the beginning of friend and we’re getting somewhere
Also we still dont know why Zay left😶😶
"artistically I really liked the golden tears against the cool, colored scene. well done :)"
Everyone talking about how Kade was friend zoned but Zay doesn’t even understand the concept of a boyfriend yet... y’all wildin’! She’s an alien learning about human concepts. I’m looking forward to the  next episode 😍🥰❤️
"seeing comments like “kiss kiss ” is kinda childish kade is dealing with a 4 year old break up and he’s most likely not over it yet, and zay not realizing her feelings is because she doesn’t know what they are,  she never had romantic feelings for anyone that  including being in a relationship..."
Don’t friend zone him Zay 😭 it doesn’t help that Kade won’t make a move already 🙄
Every one thinks that zay is putting kade in the friendzone. Don't you guys remember the photo she doesn't know what friends actually mean or that it has levels. She doesn't even know what romance means.
“I’m still stranger status”  And you better stay that way shithead
This story helps me get through the week like can't wait for the next episode
Me just counting down the episodes until rule 3 is officially broke
When Zayed just dumped the rest of the fries in her mouth. now that's a mood.
"Y’all are saying Zaida friend zoned Kade, but you gotta remember episode 17 when Zaida called the Delilah and Kade “friends” in the picture."
I wonder when we get to learn why she left her home planet
Zadia likes what she sees and I am in agreement with her.
"*silent screenshots of Kade getting out the shower* Edit: this was a just a joke, guys. I didn't actually take screenshots, lol"
👀👀👀 he has a fever oh noes.... Zaida quick kiss him so he will heal... I mean call the bois
my boi said aight imma head out. *plop*
Kade's bringing sexy back
"Kade's into collarbones, whereas Zaida looks like she might get into backs. Match made on earth??? 😏😏"
"Lol total cliche he says, and then gets sick from the rain"
so Zay is about to get the true American experience by discovering how expensive medicinal care is in America :)
You know Zaida wanted to act out that scene instead of him reading it lol
Kade has a collarbone kink and she has a back kink💀😂
okay so this is not good but WHAT ARE YOU READING MISS GIRL???
There is so much to love about this episode but mainly Zay's increasing awareness. She notices how Kade has been sacrificing his personal comfort and preference for her happiness and that would get anybody open. Of COURSE she notices his back is handsome after that. And she may not have been able to read it but comics are visual mediums above all. SHE KNEW! She didn't want him to to yet either. Poor Kade is all tuckered out. I hope he stays all night. *brow wiggle *
Kade: I’m dead 😵... I’m alive 😃but I’m dead 😵
rule 3 just disappeared like my dad
Please like this comment if you’re a guy (Trying to prove to my friends I’m not the only one)
"I’m super interested to know what her home planet was like, and why she felt the need to leave. I’m glad she’s establishing a real life on earth but I’m soooo curious 🥺 I know it’ll come up eventually"
True love’s kiss... it’ll work... I promise 👀
Kade had no Nipples
"aww kade is sick ZAIDA GET THE NURSE OUTFIT!!!!:@×\3%*)@,.:'"
Zay help your mans out before he dies lonely
Son got covid
"Y’all reckon that Kade is gonna get so sick he’s gonna be delirious and Zaida might confess to him thinking he won’t remember, and he will?! And then we’ll be left in purgatory for like forever!"
KADE WHY DID YOU HAVE TO GO AND CALL HER DELILAH😭
Hey there Delilah what’s it like in Kade’s head? The fandom needs you to get lost so Zay can get her man
"NURSE ZAIDA 💖 she’s trying so hard, but Delilah? I need to know what’s next 😩"
I lost my shit when she just dumped ice cubes on him!
"🎵🎶Hey there Delilah, whats it like to live so rent free in our alt e-boy Kade's head  yeah we know he's such a dummy he closed his eyes... our alien girl is so surprised  and we know why 🎵🎶 more"
The homie Kade got all of us feeling 20 different emotions in just that last part lol
I think Delilah cheated on him
"Hey there Delilah, stop ruining the moment!"
"Hey there Delilah, what’s it like inside Kade’s noggin? You’re a thousand miles away, but with Zay there’s just no stoppin oh these two.  There’s simply nothing you can do.  We know it’s true.   Hey there Delilah, could you move a little over? Kade and Zay would be so happy if he just stepped up and told her how he feels.  You’re just a wound but it’ll heal.  Zay’s his real deal.   Ohhhhhh Zay and Kade for daaaaays Ohhhhhh Zay and Kade for daaaaays more"
F**k Delilah all my homies hate Delilah
SO WHOLESOME  ... and then YIKES
when you think she actually knows something off instinct and then she pours ice on you
Does anyone else get bummed out when he calls her an idiot? :/
Hey there Delilah please go back to New York City
THE WAY I RAN TO THIS EPISODE 🏃🏾‍♀️🏃🏾‍♀️🏃🏾‍♀️🏃🏾‍♀️
plot twist the fever is an act.
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
I'll say it- F*CK DELILAH THO
First was like Yiiiiiisssssssss then I was like NOOOOOOOOOOO
Rule 3 busting in like my mom when I've snuck snacks into my room at 2 am
Zaida: DO I LOOK LIKE—
"Get this... turn into an anime, dub with corpse and the voice of starfire. Jk... unless 👉👈"
"Thicc thighs save lives, but thigh highs are my demise"
Aww she cares about him so much 🥺💕
Why won’t zaida talk about her past!? I’m dying to know
I hope that Kade can start healing from his breakup. The author portrays the aftermath of a really big heartbreak well.
“I do not know what to do with this number” Literally me in math class:
"me 1 year ago: Ha, I'm never paying for this app Me now: Kade is sick, quickly take my coin and make him better pleaaaase!"
This webtoon makes Mondays better. They also make waiting for the next monday torture.
Remember when rule 3 was a thing
I would pay ungodly amounts of money to see this turned into a crunchyroll original
"Ok I need to just put it out there but what if, hear me out, Zaida was meant to get “married” on her home planet (maybe she’s royalty or something). However she had no interest in her chosen partner so she ran away. My second thought is her planet got destroyed and she’s the last survivor. Both of these reasons aren’t something people would want to discuss so it would make sense for her not to talk about her past."
Ayo Kade got covid this ain't good
I think Zaida has suffered what kade has suffered on planet zodia👀
I HATE HOW FAST I READ
"🎵Hey there Delilah what's it like in Kade's memories🎵 --- 🎵We want you to go away because the ship we built has no room left for you...🎵 --- 🎵We can't set sail until you do... Just get out, dude...🎵"
Our space baby is growing up 👽✌🏼
OK if I have to wait more than three episodes for her to hurry the F up with this love train shit i’m going to flip sh*t: edit if you like my comment then if leave the name of a comic you made then I will make another edit and enter it into my comment you have until 10 o’clock to do so
"""You're killing this Earthling thing."" ""thank you!"" ""No I mean you're literally killing the Earthling, I'm going to die with this fever pls call the doctor."""
"oh ffs, KISS HIM"
Rule three? We don’t know her
aw she is nurse Zay to the rescue
not me using my coins🙄bye bye cash.🏃‍♀️
i literally paid for this and i can't wait for the next one
fuk im outta coins
The way they look at each other 💖
DUDE ETHAN IS LITERALLY US
does Zaida need to bury a body? we got shovels around here.
man i wish these episodds release faster
BURY THE BODY AND DESTROY ALL EVIDENCE. WE GOT YOU ZAIDA 💙
"her massive blush at the words ""making out"" give me massive seratonin"
TELL US ZADIA WE DON’T CARE IF YOU WIPED OUT A PLANET OR TWO!
Is it just me or is the author testing our patience on rule 3
i wish he got his fever from them making out in the rain
Anyone else getting lost princess abandoned the throne due to arranged marriage vibes?  Im at least trying to avoid the Murder vibes
"You know at first I didn't like Ethan that much, but now I'm starting to LOVE him."
is it just me or was this ep shorter?
OMG SHE KILLED HER ENTIRE RACE JUST LIKE THE DOCTOR AND CAME TO EARTH FOR ASYLUM
Zaida don’t worry about it everyone here will help bury the body... right y’all?
At least we know kade doesn’t have corona.
THEORY- She ran away from the hone planet because she was forced to be married and then she killed the guy and fled.....that’s why she’s so scared to talk about it...
Ethan is zadias gay best friend even tho he isn't gay
Did Zaida commit mass genocide?
"I KNEW IT THE WHOLE TIME, SHES A DAMN SPACE WAR CRIMINAL!!!!!!!!!"
Yes Zay I’ll still be your friend 🥺
I never clicked on WEBTOON so fast after seeing the Notification
if Zaida tells Ethan her past before Kade and Kade found out I wonder if he'd be hurt by that 🤔
i kinda wish they maked out
"Once this episode is released to those without fast pass, it will be a year since pookie released episode 1 of Down To Earth. That's crazy to think about!"
Lol he's still stranger status
Oh no it’s Stace! I hope he doesn’t try any stunts while Kade is still on the mend! Also glad to know Zaida’s not a murderer lol
Kade gon wake up throwing hands... or throwing up
Stranger danger ⚠️
everyone let's just hope that Stace doesn't try to make a move one her
I didn’t really like Ethan at first but now I feel like I can trust him a lil bit more
“Down to earth” How Dare You. Lol “Roll Credits”
Ok but who wants to bet she is royalty and she had an arranged marriage and so she ran away from her planet zadia
STOPPPPP I CAN’T KEEP WAITING 😩 I wish to know more 💖
Anyone else actually worried that zay was a murderer ? Nah she wouldn’t hurt a fly
I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE ETHAN
"I love when one of the characters quotes the name of the book, in this case webtoon, inside the book! 😂🤭 It's such a great inside joke for us readers! 😁"
IF STACE TRIES ANYTHING WHEN KADE IS SICK IM GOING TO KILL HIM ANYONE WANNA HELP :)))
Me just waiting for a whole fleet of alien ships to come drag Zadia back home
wow; ethan is such a good person and friend. we stan you ethan 🥸
I need to see kade and zaida kiss...👁️👄👁️❤️❤️❤️
uh oh spaghetti-o (also people stop disliking comments to become top comment it’s selfish ty)
OH NO WHY IS HE THERE >:O
bet she's gonna close the door on him lmao
I giggled a little too hard when hearing that Stace is a stranger😂
"This is not ok, he better not or I will kick his ass, she is kades love"
yessss i love overprotective Kade!!
KADES LIKE NO SHES MINE GET TF OUTTA HERE edit: (no way this is 2nd top comment rn)
you would rock that job Zaida! just watch out for “stranger” >:c
*Kade used hug from behind* It’s super effective!
kade getting manically overprotective love to see him being her not boyfriend the 3rd rule really is just going out the window huh
"Kade woke up from a daggone coma to be like, MINE! lol he slept through an entire study session with Ethan but let Zay be outside for 5 minutes and his spidey senses start tingling lol I cannot for the life of me get a read on Stace. He is so hard to pin down. He seems innocent enough but he still troubles me. idk"
Kade make a move or I swear to god I’m gonna...
Kade -dead to the world- Also Kade - STAAACCCEEE💥
"Overprotective kade? ✅ Zay being beautiful as always? ✅ The cat being adorable? ✅ Me spending coins by the second? ✅ Hotel? Trivago Edit: 587 likes... 😵 impossible (thx tho!) Edit 2: 674 likes HOW, ty 😅 Edit 3: fr came back months later to find like 100 more likes lmao"
I would pay good money to see the panel showing Kade in bed resting then realising Stace is at the door talking to Zaida 🤣
Ok but Kade is making feather tattoos look hot 😂 *goes to look up tattoo pictures*
"Kade was all like, “Don’t you dare touch my 🍐!”"
AHHHH THE WAY KADE HELD ZAIDA ♥️
Wow his stare at her thighs made me ✨uncomfortable✨
"grabs Zaida ""Can we help you?"""
"Kade minds: "" My thick alien waifu! MINE!"""
Kade is about to throw some hands 😤
Rule 3? Never heard of her.
The way Kade grabbed her 😩🧸💕🥺✨
It was the sparkly thicc thighs Stace was starting at for me 😂 He really forgot his name for a second there.
AH WTF THE WAY HOW HE WRAPS HIS ARMS AROUND HER I love ittttt
Kade claiming his girl❤️❤️
The noise I made when Kade grabbed her like that-
she’s like look i dont care abt the ex i want a job you emo racoon
Zay when she see’s kades memories with delilah: “why is it ✨SpIcY✨”
I NEED A TIME MACHINE TO GO TO NEXT WEEEEEEEKKK.
Cue the scene from the office* OMG ITS HAPPENING! EVERYBODY STAY CALM! STAY CLAM!STAY FCKING CALM!!! EVERYBODY CALM TF DOWN!😂
I'll show you mine if you show me yours
"“It’s fine, it’s not like I don’t have thoughts like that myself” GIRL MISS GIRLLL edit: HOLY MOTHER OF JEBUS THATS A LOT OF LIKE OH MY"
The way Kade says friends you can tell he is disappointed
The plot thickens! Zaida’s certainly been a lot more courageous lately... and I love it!
What if she gets a memory from sexy time😳
Not kade thinking Zay is thinking the same thoughts as him 😭😂
She said “I have weird thoughts like that too” yooooo Zay I see you 😂🤣
THE CLIFF HANGERS KILL MEEEEE
Aww one way to greet him when he got off your bed😏🥺 I don’t know who Rule 3 is
God the way they look at eachother is just pure magic! Makes me believe in love again!
"Y'know, I didn't realize it at first... but dang, did you nail the feel of the ""Starfire"" way of speaking. She feels like someone who is just beginning to understand the language and uses the stranger, less used ways of speech. Bigger words and such, stuff most modern people wouldn't use. I applaud you! I even spent a few bucks to binge the series. Keep on trucking!"
"wait, no.... I need more....... GOD DAMMIT I NEED MORE THAN THAT!"
If zay used her telepathy on cosmo would she be able to communicate with him?
See alien world or continue to be sad Boi over bad ex... MAN IF YOU DONT PICK THE ALIEN WORLD IMA RAGE
"“You’re not hot anymore.”  Kade’s always hot, what’re you talking about?  You think he lets you peak the happy trail for nothin’?"
on God they better kiss in this next episode
WHEN SHE GRABBED HIS FACE OMG
I’ve been robbed there was supposed to be a kiss 👀
I swear Every time i read this in hear nothing but the original Teen Titans voice actors for charaters! Edit: I still can not decide the proper voice for Stace tho
"KADE AND ZAY ARE REALLY BREAKING RULE 3 OUT HERE AND IM L I V I N G FOR IT   Edit: y'all rule three was ""no falling in love"" since half of the responses to this are wondering what that is"
"The ""ok I'll share"" got me on the peek of extinction👏🤜"
If I saw some of the stuff they said at the beginning without context I would’ve thought they were about to jump off a cliff or something 😭🤚oh and CONGRATS POOKIE ON THE 1 YEAR ANNIVERSARY. I think all of us can agree that we love how much work you put into this comic!! The art work is so amazing and the storyline is *mwah* chefs kiss. Anyways to put it short know you’re appreciated!!!! OH MY GOD I JUST SAW TODAY IS YOUR BIRTHDAY TOO BECAUSE I DEFINITELY WASN’T STALKING YOU SO HAPPY BIRTHDAY! more
HOLY SHIT SHE REALLY LOOKS LIKE ZAIDA
"Hmmm... I’m a little sus of Delilah. Seems like she maaaay be a bit of the manipulative type, we will see. >.>"
Anybody reading this so far and have an opinion that Delilah was more negative energy than positive
"Maybe I already feel biased about Delilah, but does it not seem like she’s only interested in Kade now cause he has a car, and a job and money? Also why she’s trying to make him feel bad? Like ‘this is you last chance to see me, why aren’t you kissing my ass?!’ Eff off! 😤 I’ll be interested to know what the rest of the memory is!"
Zay is an alien and still knows more about consent than Apollo. Edit: @simplife reminded me that he is also referred to as ASSpollo
my boi boutta get the sloppy toppy at the playground
Delilah looks like Zays evil twin
the two of them looking at each other like that just to exchange information... lawdddd 😳
Every week we get closer and closer to a kiss…
UGH forget kade’s memories I WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED WITH ZAY😭😭😭😭 (obvi kades matter too guys)
"so... who wants a kiss? I WANT A KISS SOON PLEASE, THANKS"
Anyone else think Delilah seems kinda...crappy??? Like this tiny snippet we got tells me she’s not the greatest person imho
She looks so much like her!!!!!! (Such short episodes but I love them)
The mutual respect between Zay and Kade is so adorable.. I dont wanna compare but the way Delilah treated him was kinda mean.. I hope that as we learn more about their relationship we understand why he fell inlove with her in the first place..
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THE CUTE LITTLE LIZARD?!?!? 🦎🦎🦎🦎🦎
"wait a minute..... Zaida said that everyone on Zodia looked the same...... What if Delila was like, the child of a refugee or something? and that's why they look so similar? just a thought"
Congratulations on your 1 year anniversary! you've done amazing work and I love your story.
I thought they were going to kiss for sure(sooo close)
I love how many of us came back for Cherri
bro she looks just like Zaida!!!
Man this seriously hit hard. I feel for Kade...he probably never truly grieved for his break up with her so seeing the memories just brought back the pain. I hope that Zaida can help him properly heal from this. 🥺
All he wanted was a hug
"Poor Kade, I’m so glad Zay is there for him giving him support 🥺♥️"
Cannon looks so much like stace! But their personalities are polar opposites
"ok soooo since the memory cracked when Kade showed Cannon, then again when going through the breakup with Delilah i have a very heartbreaking suspicion that she cheated on him with Cannon... maybe that’s why he doesn’t like his boss at Spenders cause they look so much like Cannon/is related to them??"
It’s probably a bad thing that his favorite memory of Delilah was at the very beginning of their relationship ://
"so no top comment on how stace is definitely cannon? like forget theories no bs, that has to be him. every character in this comic has distinct features"
i dont think a snickers bar can fix that
Oh man...this is essentially trauma processing therapy for Kade. I'm glad they're not together yet going through this. They can't have a healthy relationship until Kade deals with his past.
"man... if your favorite memory of someone is from when you first got together, maybe that's a sign the relationship wasn't right. it sucks and it hurts. I want Kade to be able to heal."
"For those saying they think Delilah died, in Ep 28 Ellie says that they ‘broke up for who knows why?’ She ain’t dead! Surely by now y’all have an idea of what Kade is like as a person, he’s shy and awkward, and has low self esteem, he probably blames himself for everything that went wrong in their relationship, and when you’re with someone for five years especially as a teen, a lot of who you are is who you are when you’re with them!"
Did Cannon remind anyone else of Stace!??
"I don’t know why, but seeing the squiggly hiccup speech bubbles makes this scene even more impactful and immersive, perfectly embodying an emotional meltdown."
"That was incredibly sad...but necessary. You're grieving because it meant something to you, because you're human, and because you cared. Glad he can finally let it out ❤. Am I the only one that thinks that Canon guy has something to do with this..."
Theory: Delilah left Kade for Cannon.
So Cannon looks exactly like Stace...
"I know this is so sad... but from an artistic stand point, I like the shattered memory panels. It really helps take you through an emotional journey."
Sorry wallet... daddy needs his fix.
I don't know if this is subtly hinting at their relationship being very toxic from the fact that Kade's favorite memory with her is from before they even started dating... kinda sus bro kinda sus
"Poor Kade. Not only did he lose his love but since we never see the other kids from his group, while Zaida's been there, I bet he lost them after the break up too.😢"
"I think it’s even harder for kade because he’s trying so hard to connect with zay, but having to think about what happened is mentally killing him. But I think Zay is honestly helping because he needs to stop hiding his feelings and let it out"
I think that Delilah was interested in him because he was independent and doing his own thing.... which made him seem more interesting than others....
"Stace IS cannon. Go back to ep 54, Zadia says “your name is stace right?” And he totally spaced out. He probably dropped his friends and revamped his whole identity"
Kinda wanna see zaida a memories now that I’ve seen kades anyone agree?
ok rule number three is so far gone
ok welp take my money and see ya next week 🤟😌 (Edit: no way both of my comments are top comment rn) (Another Edit: same number of dislikes lol?)
"Ohhh they both are starting to catch some big feels for each other 😍😍 This is so sweet, wholesome and healthy. I hope Kade will be able to be there for her when she needs it. They’re already starting to become one of my fave power couples 👊 💜"
"My fellow guys, it is perfectly normal and acceptable to cry."
"I really appreciate the display of physical intimacy without necessarily making it sexual. Like, obviously I think most of want them to do the hanky panky, but I really appreciated how willing Zay was to physically comfort Kade, and how he didn’t even think to take advantage of it—and then when he actually NOTICED how close he was, his first thought was the sound of her heart. Very well done! I can’t wait to read more."
"Lol @ all the comments saying now was the perfect time for a kiss. Here’s why that really isn’t a good idea: 1) Kade just went through something emotionally painful, and isn’t quite sure what he should be doing about what he feels for Zay. Nor is he fully over Delilah. 2) Zay doesn’t totally know what she’s feeling for Kade (even though it’s obvious to us readers). Both of them need to have some more emotional growth before smooching is in the cards. Thank you for listening to my TED Talk."
I don’t think kade truly healed from the break up like covering a bullet hole with a band-aid like when he immediately went to other girls right after the break up so he wouldn’t be able to face his pain but with this zaida is unintentionally forcing him to face his pain and go through it with her by his side. I LOVE THIS COMIC MAN
I live for the slow burn 🥺
NOPE! Kade you said it the right way! OUR SHIP IS ABOUT TO SAIL 🎉🤩
"Webtoon Notification: ""Down to Ear-"" Me: Say less"
I'm starting to think Zay likes pancakes more than she likes Kade.
When I picture her voice it's Starfire lol. anyone else??
Okay raise your hand if you have no financial self control 🙋🏻‍♀️😂
"Ok so I have a theory about Zaida regarding Zodia. What if she was a princess or in a family of high influence, and didn't have the freedom to live her life the way she wanted to? I'm genuienly looking forward to see her memory. I love that we are exploring Kade's feelings and memories, but I'm dying to learn more about Zaida and her life on Zodia"
Rule 3 is kinda turning into non existent
Rule #3 is officially dead.  When's the funeral?
because you meant it like that😌
You said it cuz ur IN LOVE WITH HER. God give me strength 😭
i love this.....but the slow burn is killing me 🥲 **edit: ohhh ok thank you @🍌Banana🍌 lol**
Hey so um can you kiss her please
"A minute ago, I had six free coins. Now I have one."
BREAKING NEWS:Rule 3 was brutally murdered. Investigators are still trying to find out what happened. Are Kade and Zaida going to keep catching feeling? Find out on the next episode of Wizard Of Oz.
"kade, this gurl needs to be your girlfriend, like, now"
“ would you like to stay forever “ is what he is thinking
"this sexual tension is too much😖 but I love it so much 🥰😍  didn't realize this would be a top comment... and get all this negative attention? lol but obviously they both have feelings for eachother!! it's just not out in the open... yet.  I think it can be both sexual and romantic tension, don't come for me guys 😅 more"
I see those heart shapes in that steam
"ok false alarm i thought he was gonna kiss her but yk head telepathy is still alr baby steps i say, baby steps😌"
wait did anyone else notice kade ate the little thing off zays face
Who else is searching through the comments to see who agrees that they’re SO DAMN CUTE😤😤😤
no 😖no😖nooooooo 😫 please author these cliff hangers are illegal😫
"Anyone else think he was going in for a kiss?? Between the steam hearts, sad look at ""you don't want me here forever"" (which yes he absolutely does), and the hand holding, 100000% thought he was going in for a kiss."
"honestly, the only reason I look forward to Mondays..."
I Want Zay To Feel Independent And Be Independent But I Also Want Her To Live With Kade Forever lmao
"was it just me or was this chapter way shorter then usual?? EDIT!!!! yall seem to think Im complaining, I'm not. I'm an artist myself, I know this shit takes time, I'm not asking for a speed up, Im not asking for longer episodes, I was simply asking if it was shorter or if it was just me because I read so fast."
the hearts in the steam omg 🥰
That head BOOP is the cutest 😭💕
Kade  Zay is your future girlfriend just say you love her.
*waits a week* new issue is out! must read! (30 seconds later) *waits a week again 😭*
🎶🦀Shalaalalala don’t be shy go on a kiss da girl🦀🎶
Rule 3? What rule 3? I don’t know of this “rule 3” of which you speak.
"can we talk about just how gorgeous suzy is? like for real? the whole aesthetic, the outfits? no? no one's gonna talk about her? damn...."
I find myself frequently rereading this whole comic.
Ayo shout out to Olive Tea
Even the freaking cup noodles ship them.
Y’all notice the hearts coming out the cup of noodles ORRRRR
“Ethan! I don’t need you anymore!” Ethan: Scuse me?
I love this comic so much. am I right? or am I right? it's good.
This is a certified bruh moment! Lol but really I’m glad to see that Zaida has a much better understanding of the language!
someone has said this before but ethan is literally us 😂
I LOVE THIS BUT I ALSO JUST REALIZED THE NAME OF THE MANGA SHE IS READING
Kade is so heartbroken she wants to explore alone and so am I! just date already! this sexual tension is killing me!
"Anyone else imagine Zay saying ""Bruh"" in a Starfire voice? 🤣🤣😂😂"
“Bruh..” “ why are you making fun??” “I don’t need you anymore”. This was a good chapter!  I love every panel. It was super wholesome. 10 out of 10 recommend 🤣🥰
"Imagine if Ethan said ""Bruh"" after that ""I don't need you any more""."
Ethan is definitely the captain of our ship
bro I'm running out of coins😭😭😭😭
I wonder how they would be able to get Zay into the system to even apply for a job without raising questions.
"Bruh, the look on Kade's face when Zay said she wanted to be out on her own one day... 😪"
Explore Earth Together! 🥺❤️
Could I get a copy of Sensei and my Magic Sex Tie... purely for research purposes of course.
Zaida:I DONT NEED YOU ANYMORE!😁Ethan:👁👄👁
I will continue to make myself broke for this  amazing comic!
WE STAN FRIENDS LIKE ETHAN
"""I'm happy it was Kade"" oh my GOODNESS! I can't be the ONLY ONE here who got super excited to read this!"
"take my dang cash you jerks, im to freaking hooked."
Ethan:how long was the session.     Kade:bout a hour Ethan:ohh spicy.    kade: 😐You mf bit-
Zaida: “Explore earth on my own one day” *Kade’s heart left the chat*
KADE GOT SAD WHEN SHE SAID SHE WANTED TO EXPLORE EARTH WITHOUT HIM IM SOBBING
Ethan knows... he knows...
"Not Kade thinking he’s slick 😃 if obvious was a person, you’d be them, kade."
we saw that blush sir😏
MANS PULLED OUT A 100 WOAH
get her a deviant art account asap Kade.  edit : my 1st top comment.  thanks everyone ☺.
kade peacefully watching her draw was so cute 🥺
"""ready to learn about taxes and credit scores?"""
bro ngl Ethan will help the ship sail
Not Ethan being wholesome and helping her with her career. It’s almost like he’s amazing or something
Ethan paying artists what they deserve for commissions is a very very good boy
BRO THE WAY ETHAN IS WHIPPING OIT BENJAMINES
"I mean, without a social security number, or proof she was born on Earth, her options were always going to be limited. Artist is best case scenario"
that one look was ethan planning kade and zay's entire wedding in 2 seconds  (edit: I just looked at this comment a year later and I'm shocked it got that many likes- TY! <3)
"Zay, whatever you do, don't work at a Taco Bell."
I've never met a walmart manager that could throw $100 dollar bills around like that 🤣
plot twist: this is pooki senpai's autobiography
Ethan is literally the whole fandom 😭🤚🏼
100 FOR 1 DRAWING? DO 9 MORE 😂
How are every single one of Zaida’s faces so adorable??
Kade ganna get jealous when she starts getting independent
ethan really said “caught you in 4k 😏📸
$40?? $100??? Now THAT'S how you show your artist friends some love ❤much more supportive than asking them to cut you a deal or commission a piece for free 🥰
Bro why do I keep crushing on BOYS WHO DONT EXIST
Iwannahaveallkindsofunwithyou. Kade2021 we stan❤️. Edit:Ty so much this is my first ever top comment on my first WEBTOON I ever read thank you so much.
Kade and your weird kinks 🤭😂  But Zaida will look so dang cute with earrings 😍
Kade wants all the fun 😂
kade accidentally dirty talking with zaida and her completely misunderstanding is the best
KADE’S PLUGS HAVE HEARTS I REPEAT KADE’S PLUGS HAVE HEARTS
Kade can’t control himself anymore😭 homie is SWEATINNN❗️ SWEATIN BUCKETS
Made really saw her NECK and had an out of body experience 🤣🤣
THERE BETTER BE A KISS IN THE NEXT FEW EPISODES OR IM GONNA
"THATS IT, KADE IM SENDING YOU TO HORNY JAIL"
"Kade darling, you’re kink is showing 🌚😛"

The introverts are always kinksters 🤪

webtoon: down- me: SHUT UP IM HERE 🏃🏽‍♀️🏃🏽‍♀️
So he has heart plugs and a happy hat? 🥳
and with that horny comment it's time to go see if this artist has a patreon 😏
spiderman kiss 👀 anyone catch that 💯
Did any one else notice the heart shape in Kade's gauges?
So when do you think he's gonna realize their on a date
An no one is going to talk about him remembering his ex by looking at our cinnamon roll?Am I missing something??
kade's horny meter went off
That I just took a shit shirt was perfect
I know people want romance but we need more of Kade’s Bromance scenes! EDIT: 🤦‍♂️ Seems a few commenters are actually misinterpreting what Bromance means?😂
am i the only one who sets an actual alarm just a minute before so i know exactly when it is up …just me? (Edit: people are annoying yes i can turn on notifications but it’s delayed but ty for top comment)
kade: don’t go to the back of the store zaida: 🧏🏽‍♀️ y’all hear sum
"Noooo, not the back of the store. I mean, Zaida is 20 but she's seems so innocent. She will be asking so many questions.....and I kinda wanna see it. XD"
“Don’t go to the back of the store” can’t wait to see how Kade explains that stuff 😂😂
Kade: Don't go to the back of the store! Zay: >:3
"""don't go to the back of the store"" ahh yes classic line for a first trip to ""spenders"""
"She is beauty, she is grace, she keep bumping into people kade knows with her face."
Read too fast regret is setting in
Anyone else see her mischievous smile when she was going to do exactly the OPPOSITE of what Kade told her not to do?
"Thank u creator for this friendship! Men are rarely portrayed in comics with a really wholesome kind of friendship. Instead male characters are usually pitted against each other or have a less ""tender"" per se kind of friendship. And while that's a fine friendship to have, I love that the creator is letting the male characters be not just friendly but even sweet. I look forward to the future of this bromance!!"
"LMAO NO ZAIDA NOT THE BACK OF THE STORE, we all know what's there 😅😏"
anyone else notice blue haired girls blushies??? just me? i smell a girl crush coming on
"I'm all for Kade's character development into a genuinely better person. I enjoy seeing his growth, with Zay's influence of course."
Kade mentioning the back of the store:  The entire audience: *nervous sweating*
If you’ve been to spencers... We all know what’s at the back of the store......... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"Bro you know the artist either goes to spencers a lot or works there, it’s legit designed like the one I work at, almost extsclyc lava lamps  : checks plasma ball: check, really in funny poop t-shirt: check, love toys in the back: check, now all they need is a wall of mugs thag never sell but they just keep getting more lmao"
Did it update late for anyone else too??
I STARTED DYING WHEN HE TOLD HER TO NOT GO TO THE BACK OF THE STORE LMFAOOOOO
We need to get Zaida a damn bell! 😭💗 little Ms.Doing her own Thang!
So we’re all here rn?
"Zai trying to pull a “I do what I want” while being a cherry tomato in the 18+ section is just comedy gold  Edit: Woah! Thanks for the love, everyone!"
"I can’t wait to see Suzy find out zaida and kade live together, thats gonna be a whole rollercoaster"
"""I do what I want"" damn straight"
They really censored the whole wall 😭
Anyone have the feeling sOmeOne migHt be Gay 😩
Suzy at kades place and seeing them living together is gonna be an interesting experience 😆. She's probably gonna call him a pervert again too 😂
"Stace ain't jealous of Kade, he's jealous of Zadia"
am i the only one that feels like she didn’t just give her Zay her number to “pierce her ears”? 👀
"I’m sure the reason why stace is acting different is because he can no longer relate to kade. Both of them didn’t have friends. When stace found out kade DOES have friends and hangs out with zaida, he felt defeated. It was easy to pester someone who was shy and awkward but now he sees that’s not the case and that kade is changing for the better. It makes stace jealous."
I knew my gaydar was right.
the entire back of the store was censored except for the people lol
THE BACK OF THE STORE BROKE ZAY’S INNOCENCE 😭
All the blushes with Zay and Suzzie give me bi vibes 💜 (even though ZayxKade is def OTP)
"Kade upon meeting Suzy and staring at her for a while: gets called a pervert, followed by lots of awkward interactions    Zaida upon meeting Suzy and staring at her for a while: has an interesting conversation, gets her number, and has plans to see her again that evening"
I knew Stace had a thing for our man kade!!
I’m like 99% sure the manager wants Kade 😂
Well Zay now knows why Kade tried to keep her away from the back of the store🤣🤣 but it looks like more people are starting to realize Zade is a thing ❤️💞
I accidentally screenshotted but I deleted it I’m sorry  pls don’t arrest me
AYO WHERE THE UPDATE 😭⁉️
POOKIE? We hope you’re okay ❤️
not the censored EVERYTHINGGG 😭😭
"Here come the ""Are y'all dating?"" questions."
ugh why isn't tonight actually TONIGHT!? 😩
my man busted out of the closet like the kool-aid man
Kade is coming out of the closest. Biggest twist of all.
When your so early that not even the “First” people are here
i cannot be the only one who thought homegirl was about to confess 😭
"Zay: ""I keep something personal in the closet"" 💕 Kade: *pops out of closet*"
The fact that he knew without even looking lmao
Her face when she said the other child died…
Kade came out of the closet faster than I did in high school lmao
THE WAY HE YEETED HIMSELF OUT THE CLOSET 😭😭😭
"""i dont want to keep up with lies"" *proceeds with an elaborate lie*"
Ahh! She's gonna find out Zaida's an alien! Yay! More people to love Zay!
"Poor Kade, he tries his best to let her hang out without awkwardness of him around, just to have to jump out to try to stop her from being discovered... looks like there's going to be a new person on the alien crew."
"YO, THOSE EYES ARE SET AT 20,000 LUMENS!"
Suzy standing there like: 👁👄👁
I love how he knew it was going to happen right after she was asked to be friends 🤣
"""I have a dumb idea""  *best plan ever 10/10 nothing can go wro-* ""ZAY YOUR EYES!!!""  me: you had 1 job"
Well damn
"lol Kade, my mans, why the closet??? 🤣"
Wait her eyes actually glow?! I thought that was just an artistic choice 😂
Man ran out hella fast- he knows her so well I’m so invested 😭  Edit: I love how her eyes glow- suzy is such a nice character as well TwT
"""I dont want to have to keep up with lies"" *proceeds to concoct a new massive lie that will definitely backfire*"
"""that's where I keep my personal items"" *Kade busts out*"
damn suzy really tryna steal Zay like that
YO WHY DOES EVERYONE WANT HER FOR THEMSELVES YALL NEED TO CHILL LOL
you know kade won’t let that slide
"HOLD UP— WAIT A MINUTE— now look suzy, queen, i like you very much and you seem harmless, but we still tryna get this ship afloat, you can’t just come in and ruin that!! ✋🏾😤"
......um that's gonna be a hell no from Kade and probably the audience.
"she really went from ""like zoinks man, let's get out of here!"" to ""live with me"" real quick."

Suzy: 🎶It's Mrs. Steal Yo Girl🎶
kade be like: 👁👄👁
kade is now demoted from main lead to third wheel feels bad
NO STOP ON BEHALF OF ALL OF WEBTOON YOU CAN NOT HAVE HER
Mcwhat 😀
It was really wholesome and then it became SUS AS HELL
Sorry for the delay. Episode update shortly. :)
"Like you just ran from her in terror, now you want her to live with you? It's probably cause she doesn't like Kade and wants to pull some 'girls shouldn't have boys as roommates' bs just to spite him. Zaida happens to enjoy her pancakes with Kade dang."
BACK UP SUZY SLOW YOUR ROLL
"wait no, something went wrong, think my webtoons messed up, thought I read Suzy tryna steal Kade's space girl"
"guys listen to this... zaida moves in w suzy and now kade lives alone right? what if while they’re separated they realize how much they really like eachother, then the romance really starts to build up? sounds pretty good to me"
NOOO DONT STEAL ZAY. WE WERE SO CLOSE TO GETTING THE SHIP WE WANTED
AYO??? ZAY DONT LEAVE YOUR BOY KADE LIKE THAT
"Bruh, I wanna know what happens next I don't care how many coins it takes"
"I just got an idea. You (author) should make Down to Earth FUNKO POPS!! Wouldn’t a floating Zay funko pop just be so AWESOME?! Ideas: Kade, Floating Zay, Ethan, Stace,  Suzy, and any other ideas. Also you could probably get some money on them. Just an idea."
"no no... please let's not forget that a few episodes back Kade was saying he'd ""be lost without her""!! I'm all for Zay making new friends but I want to see more of her life before Earth and get more Zay and Kade relationship development ❤️"
"INSTABAM: ZAIDA.NOTALIEN———————————————————ME: I don’t know guys, kinda sus of this Zaida girl."
THANK GOD SHE SAID NO!!! 😩✨
I WANNA JOIN HER INSTABAM 🥰🥰🥰
idk if you blush about your cute alien friend from literal outer space saying you're her best friend... you might just love her. sorry I don't make the rules.
"“i am a normal earthling” yup, checks out"
Where can I read “up to Mars”
LMAO ITS A REAL IG ACCOUNT
Kade blushing makes everything better
not gonna mention the fact that it said WEBTOON -Up to Mars- 😂
AIIYO WHO ELSE SAW THE SAUCE ACCOUNT?
This could end terribly
Y’all reckon that maybe Zay will come across Delilah’s instabam?! Or the other way round? 😬
Before you know it Zay gets on TikTok
Awww the WEBTOON notification 😂
"Kade gushing in the shower, I feel you bro... I relate"
"i don’t know guys, i’m pretty sure she’s not an alien"
I hope we see Zaida become something with this world and be seen as a way to build upon as a community and not a threat.
I am so glad she said no and it’s also super funny how he reacted to being called her best friend kade is literally my spirit animal
“Cough” “cough” ......🚢🔨🚢🔨🚢🔨🚢🔨🚢🔨🚢🔨🚢🔨🚢🔨 ah what a beautiful ship 😌
"i think her way of talking will just enhance ppls thinking that its a persona, i love it"
"I love how Ethan has a Webtoon notification for the ""Up to Mars"" comic. So clever."
"I'm a simple man, I see Down to Earth notification, I click fast af."
exposure brings risk...I'm nervous but excited for Zay to branch out. the internet can be a vicious place but there's beauty too.
GUYS SHES FINALLY INVITING PEOPLE ON HER OWN BECAUSE SHE HAS A PHONE IM SO HAPPY
Man I really do not like the manager at all. Not from the beginning and not now.
ok so somethings not going on between them... YET
bruh I'd turn around and walk right out of my own house
When you accidentally plan a murder in front of your crush
Idk why I hear starfire’s voice when reading Zaida’s lines
"Even if they didn't like each other, that's just inappropriate. I mean, Kade and Zay are friends (best friends!) and to here your boss call your friend sexy and talking bout them like that is very inappropriate workplace behavior. Like c'mon dude...have some self awareness. Edit: it's been brought to my attention the author took out some dialogue from when was FP read it. Originally, Stace calls Zay ""sexy"". Edit again: apparently she put back the original dialogue 🙃 idek anymore lol"
I can't be the only person that sort of thought the manager was going to ask Kade out right?
"""Hey... how y'all doin.."" 😂"
"Kade used to live in solitude, now has people over his house everyday.  his poor introvert soul xD"
"I don't think Stace likes Zaida... his face makes me think it's a ruse to make Kade jealous. I think his real crush is Kade... not that I condone what he's doing, but I still love him as a character."
This was a super short episode. I hope the author is okay.
"Hmmm I don’t like these vibes I’m getting from Stace. It’s starting to feel like he only pursued friendship with Kade to get to Zaida. I know he was trying to talk to him before, but it always seemed kinda...non committal. Like potentially just doing it to get on Kades nerves"
"The new chapter isn’t up? The last speech bubbles are missing? I’m anxious, is author okay? Is Webtoon okay? IS KAIDA OKAY?!"
Zaida: Scared Ethan: Wut Suzy: Fooooooood Cat: I WAS COMFORTABLE AND YOU SPOOKED HER
slumber partyyy
I feel like kade is gonna make a move soon
OOF! The sheer RAGE and JEALOUSY! Also why are all the non underaged characters so hot? I'm developing serious crushes on them all I swear.
Suzy was so shocked by Kade's entrance that it cured her vitiligo
So pookie posted on her Instagram April 25th that she was going on a week hiatus b/c she’s moving. So no new episode this week. Hope that calms everyone :) I was in distress until I saw that. Edit : the new episode is uppppppppppp <3
"Everyone says Zaida's off limits, but she isnt Kade's property, and she's not stupid. If Stace likes her, hes allowed to be interested, and she can turn him down herself. Kade cant act so possessive of her all the time forever and then argue 'WE'RE JUST FRIENDS"" like bruh."
"I actually like Stace (saw comments saying how people don’t like him at all). It’s been clear he has a crush on Zaida, but instead of pushing forward without a care of how Kade may feel about it, he’s asking questions to avoid potentially hurting people. He’s trying to be a good friend as well as seeing if he can pursue his crush. (At least, that’s my interpretation based on his actions and reactions.) I prefer that to someone who thinks two people may be in a relationship and then barges in."
"I don't see why everyone hates the manager, although he may not have many friends he still seems like a good guy and isn't trying to encroach on any possible relationship between Kade and Zaida. I also don't see why everyone's got their panties in a bunch over him calling her sexy, like there's literally nothing wrong with thinking someone you like looks good."
"""Rest your head on my thighs"" hell yes  *update : oh hey, my first top comment. sweet!"
When Kade is too nice to tell them to leave even tho he is screaming in the inside 😔
"Kade: Hey Zay can we talk just the two of us? Suzy: No you cannot! What up, I’m Suzy, I’m twenty-something, and I never learned how to pick up on social cues ✌️"
I swear if kade sets boundaries and doesn't tell say how he feels I will riot
Okay but can we talk about in the last panel how kade called zay zadia he never does that. This conversation kade is talking about is probably really serious to be honest.
Don’t be shy :) kick them out :)
I'm so early yayyyyyy also why can't they just go home already our boy kade is FINALLY about to * c o m m u n i c a t e *😤
I have a sinking feeling the alone time talk will make us sad...
I have a feeling Kade is going to tell Zaida to consider Suzy’s offer of living with her just until he figures out his feelings.
Kade's about to explode and confess to Zay right in front of the crew.
Kade 10 minutes after peopling:   theres the door please leave
Mans boutta release the inner devil. This boutta be bad.
"""new Down To Earth"" me: ooh yay! *doesn't show up* *minor panic attack*"
"I'm a simple person, I see Kade blushing in the preview, I spend my coins"
Tiny detail but since zay moved in kade doesn’t have lewd phone backgrounds. Example in earlier eps he had some hot chicks as his background but look at his background in this ep. Tiny detail but still noticeable.
Turning down a thigh nap is blasphemous. He should be punished for his transgressions.
"I want to be excited for their talk but knowing Kade hes gonna be all ""uhhh distance cause sad"" on us"
"KADE lol it's episode 69, rest your head on her thighs, you fool!! More srs comment: the art for this series is just getting better and better. I love Kade's expression at the end. And the soft dreamy almost-hug sequence. Plz Kade don't be a Red Dwarf about that talk later."
"I love this webtoon so much, and seeing as I'm usually a binge reader, having to wait for it to update is killing me"
"I’m all for Zay making new friends but I kinda wish the two asked Kade too if it was alright for them to be there since it’s kinda his place. I’m super uncomfortable just seeing them surprise him at his own house and then making him uncomfortable because they won’t leave. I’d be upset too, even if I didn’t need to talk to Zay."
legit would throw everyone out.
rip rule 3 2020-2021
"""dOnT fOrGeT tHe rUlEs."" sorry but they were broken a long time ago."
This cliffhanger is illegal edit: ty guys for top comment💙💕
Sometimes I wonder if he ever thinks to himself “maybe I should be the one listening to my own rules”
"Poor Zay, not having feminine hygiene products! The rules are not the only thing that were forgotten here"
PLEASE tell me it's not another spaceship.
Oh that poor girl! She really needed another girl friend who thinks of these things!
i’m gonna laugh so hard if he peed on zaida’s ship
Not the tissue paper 💀💀💀 poor Zaida
ok but no ones commenting on the fact that poor zadia hasnt had pads this entire time????
FIRST OFF SHE SAID BRUH SHE IS A TRUE LEGEND! AND SECOND IS THERE ANOTHER ALIEN!?
the next chapter will probably introduce one of Zaida's relatives...
I feel like there is a big twist coming...
Legend has it that Suzy never went home that night.
Covering her face with her hair was TOO MUCH!!
LMAOOOO bruh im a female who also obv has periods and this whole time i was thinking they meant tissue paper to wipe her ass after taking a shit not periods😭 im so slow
I can't wait to see Kade & Zaida finally understand their feelings & realize they're meant for eachother! Also there's probably another ship outside from zodia 😳
"So.... everyone is commenting on the feminine products, but I'm over here thinking.... COMPATIBILITY"
"Oh, so *NOW* you remember Rule Three? Kay."
has a yone else been wondering what happened to zays ship or is it just me .........just me okay
Zaida has now learned how to use the !brUh!... I’m proud.
"I never really thought about her biology works. Aside from her eyes, ears, levitation, and telepathic abilities, she's basically human. right?"
"Bruh if it’s someone from her planet outside , IM GOING TO FLIPPP"
Anyone just waiting for that origin story and a kiss between zaida and kade
JUST TELL HER YOU LOVE HER YOU GREAT FLUMP!!!
“YOU GUYS GOTTA GO!” *thinks about it* “wait you guys can stay in the living room. Zay you can share my bed for the night.” I’m ok with this turn of events. 😂
Ethan's Mind right now: ATTENTION! ATTENTION! THE SHIP IS COMING! I REPEAT! THE SHIP IS COMING INTO PORT
Rule three? Never met her
SHE JUST PLOOPED RIGHT NEXT TO HIM! GIVE HER THE SNUGGLES
Ethan's face when Zaida agreed just cracks me up.
this is the most painful cliffhanger
anyone selling a time machine im interested in warping to next week for no particular reason
CARELESS WHISPER KILL MEEEEEEE
Snuggle time! -I hope they wake up in an awkward position
Looks like hades and Persephone be playing golf with shiny rocks again!
Ethan is such a big KadexZadia shipper
I’m soft? 🥺👉🏻👈🏻
"Sha-La-La-La-La-La, my oh my, look like the boy too shy..🎶"
Of course she chooses the same pillow. Of course.
"So three things: 1. Judging on how Zadia describes her home planet, I’m guess she must have been living under a totalitarian rule 2. Ethan’s face is very priceless 3. By the next chapter, if she is not carrying a half-ling in her belly , I will be very upset."
"Kade be like ""we're not talking about THIS ( ) or THIS < >, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS { }"" 🤣"
"I was thinking Ethan is missing this and then he just shoots up, wide awake 🤣🤣🤣"
I cant believe I have to wait A WHOLE WEEK NOW
"I hope this isnt true but the way Zaida is talking about Zodia and how she ""doesnt feel like an object"" here on Earth makes me think she was used for procreation or other non-consensual things (along with how wide her hips are, and how its common knowledge that mothers have wide hips for childbearing) again, just a theory and I hope she didnt have to go through that but it's my thought process rn"
“SAY WHAT!?!” Lol We are all Ethan right now. Each and everyone one of us 😂
Zaida:Shouldn't we get more comfortable in here? Me:WHAT THE FU-
"""But I already knew you were a pervert"" CALL AN AMBULANCE WE HAVE A DEAD BODY"
I WAS SO READY FOR THE KISS ;-;
THEIR HEARTS ARE GOING *THA- DUMP*?! WHAT ABOUT /MY/ HEART?! HUH?! WHAT ABOUT MY HEART?!!!!!
I have to respect him for not immediatley going for it👏🏾
WE LOVE THE COMMUNICATION
DID ANYONE ELSE START SCREAMING AND HAVE TO TAKE A 5 MIN ITS HAPPENING MOMENT BEFORE SCROLLING TO SEE THAT THEY DIDN’T ACTUALLY KISS😭 btw that cliffhanger was criminal!
Alien Pillow talk hittin' different doesn't it.
He's actually really respectful wow. These characters are so good.
“But I already knew you were a pervert” LMAO Zay did you just blurt that aloud!? 🤣
"I HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER WEEK, FOR ANOTHER CLIFFHANGER, this series is literally killing me with anticipation!"
"Well now I don't want this. Zay wants to be intimate with Kade just because... I want her to WANT Kade, not just be casual with him. I can't cheer here..."
I like that he's holding back and wanting to get to know her more. like...there's chemistry but he doesn't actually know much about zay. I think he would be alot more comfortable with trying to be with her if she would open up.
kade you okay? i’ve never seen your spine this straight 😂😭
"Kade is right to have taken that beat. If you trust someone with your body and with literally guiding you into an unknown world, the least you could do is share a bit about yourself. Kade should give himself more credit."
I’m betting money on Ethan has his ear up against the door right now.
"""well I'm a women"" he jolted up so fast like he didn't know women can be like that too HAHAA"
their hearts' goin tha-thump while my wallet's going ker-plunk 👁️👄
can we appreciate the fact that this comic casually acknowledges that women want to experiment with their sexuality too.. like not in that over exaggerated innocent and embarrassed way nor in that overly sexual and aggressive way.. but in a more realistic way that shows a healthy curioisity and hesitancy 👌❤
TAKE ALL MY COINSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I was like “OMG THEY’RE GOING TO KISS!!!”😆😆😆 *all around me are familiar faces 🥲
Rule 3 at this point just got Yeeted all the way to Zodia.
"So I've seen several comments about how it's not good that Zay just wants to experiment, etc. but I don't think that's what is going on here. I think Kade is misinterpreting her meaning and that she just doesn't know how to express what she's feeling because it's new to her. I feel like what she is trying to say is not that she wants to get intimate for the hell of it, but that she wants to get intimate because it's him. Just my opinion though."
"Oh you teasin me, naughty naughty you teasin me 😏🥴"
"I swear to god if these people come looking for her and try to take her, murder will be committed"
So is she like a princess? She's already Kade's queen though so that outranks and she must stay on earth.
I truly believed I was awaiting a K I S S
I think it’s safe to say rule 3 is no more
Shes Royalty im calling it
I love the fact that they prioritized communicating over kissing. It'll make the kiss that much more satisfying when it'll happen.
wake up spooning wake up spooningwake up spooning wake up spooning!
"Seems like Zay is a big deal, but if you’re trying to tell me she’s a princess now, too late! She was always a princess in my heart ☺️👽✌️"
"I swear, this comic has me spending my whole allowance... XD Parents were pretty confused as to why... at least I'm not spending it on drugs tho"
"I was hoping for a kiss or something, but the fact they're wanting to move on together. I'm all here for growth, getting rid of old baggage, starting fresh. healthy relationship goals. 🙌"
"What I love is that Kade didn’t go for the physical intimacy first, but wanted the emotional intimacy. That’s true love :)"
"oh shit. that complicates things even further. not only is she an alien taking refuge on a planet of humans (with governments who would torture and experiment on her if she's discovered), she's the princess of her planet, so at some point, a search party will arrive to collect her... oh boy"
The Starfire similarities are getting stronger.
"damn what an absolute marvel of an episode, I love that Kade puts Zay's needs first and has the heart to listen and work on himself so that he may have a good relationship eventually (hopefully with Day duh) 💖💖💖"
ZAIDA used FORESHADOWING! It's super effective!
I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS HEALTHY COMMUNICATION
"Oh lord they coming, I'm prepared to throw down them! 😤💯"
I have suspected for a while that she was a princess and that's why she ran away because she was extremely sheltered and had no freedom which is also why she was craving freedom when she came to earth but this sounds like confirmation of that? I mean it could have been anything but I'm getting royalty vibes 👑
STOP THEIR LITTLE ✌️✌️THING IS SO FREAKING CUTE 😫
"Ah so you're telling me, what's gonna happen in some weird way, Delilah will get kidnapped by the Zodian's searching for Zay because they think it's her since they look similar lol got it"
why ain’t he turn around and spoon her🥲 like cmon now
That was so wholesome ❤ so what if they didn't kiss.
i wish one day this would be animated
You had me in the first half ngl 😂
The cat was like ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
A part of me wish it wasn't a dream and the other part wanted to see that dream continue...
Sulking Kade going boop to an electric ball is my new aesthetic
"We've been had, boys. We have been had."
I was bout to take Zaida to h*rny jail
I KNEW IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE 😭
"For a second there, thought Zaida saw his dream….lol"
WhY iS iT SpIcY🥵🥵
It was a DREAM???!!! Throws phone at wall
This cat ships it as much as we do!!
First half had me breathing way too hard 😂
"Look, I know it’s summer now, but there’s no need for this chapter to be THAT hot 🥵"
I was just like things went from 0 to 100 real f**kin quick
I HAVE BEEN JEBAITED SO HARD edit: thank you for the love <3
"We upgraded Bois, no more thigh laying, we got chest laying now 😂"
kade sleeps in jeans 😐
WHY ARE THESE SO SHORT ITS HURTING MY SOUL.
My hopes went 📉📉📉
"my first thought ""oh nooo this is a dream""  then my next thought ""omg did Zay see the dream!!??""  and now im wondering...."" did zay create the dream?"" O.o"
I swear these cliff hangers get me everytime even when the kiss was a dream i liked how the cat was just smiling lol
"Why did she call him puppy, I’m thinking kades ex treated him more like a pet than a human for saying something like that maybe 🤔"
all I can comment is.... AHHHHHHHHH *inhale* AHHHHHHHHHHHH *throw lamp* AHHHHH *flips table* AHHHHH *continues running through house*
NOT THE RIGHT QUESTION KADE!!!!
Don't u dare push her away
"YOU KNOW YOU CANT LET HER LEAVE?!?!? CHASE HER!!!   EDIT: Get out of my mentions, Calling me a Kidnapper because two people are falling for one  another and the write is establishing plot thickness???"
Excuse me? Did you just say LEAVE?!?!?!?😃
Kade that was a moment in which you stfu
When Kade kills the rest of the series with one line😣
not the misunderstandings about to occur
wait... that face on zay looked like she didn't want to leave
"bro, Kade, man to man, imma be straight with u, ur blowing this, stop give every male reading this second hand embarrassment and catch the dang fish😡"
Hear me out… what if… she just doesn’t leave
"Breathe everyone ;) Kade has shown plenty of signs he'd rather Zay stay with him. He respects her agency a lot and he's grappling with what he sees as unhealthy possessive feelings. Then there's his breakup. Kade isn't going to make a grand show of saying 'You should stay with me.'  So he's hedging, feeling out what Zaida wants. Not that he'd be fully ready for her to say she'd stay with him forever. If Zay is even mature enough about the big L love yet. Patience and a lil luck ☆"
Awwww hon 🥺 She was NOT expecting that
Is it just me or does the art look different?
The box needs to go man it’s not healthy to hold on to...but also what’s in Zay’s box??
*rolls up a magazine and smacks him on the nose* NO! BAD KADE!
The thought literally never occurred to her.
"really disappointed with people hating on Kade because he did what his character would do. guy has abandonment issues, and that's OK. What she needs to understand is that he needs someone to stick around. Then she goes pushing him to abandon what he's built up around him. he needs to get past it but she shouldnt be pushing him into throwing away what was once his life they both need to move forward in accepting what their life is NOW. Only then can you move beyond the past."
i dont think kade was trying to be mean its just the last girl that entered his life left him like trash so he must think zay will do it too eventually
Not really the wrong time. He is opening up and he doesnt want to experience the pain of someone he loves leaving him again.
You had them in bed together. ALMOST kissed. Faked us out with a sexy dream. And then punched us in the throat with this.
"I actually think it’s a good thing to ask. Even if they stay together in a relationship, letting Zay develop on her own and be independent would be so much better for her in the long run than just keeping her to himself. Let her travel earth some and find herself, let her know who she is outside of forced relationships (they were forced together by circumstances, even if it’s her choice to stay now). That way she truly knows she’s picking Kade, not just the first guy who helped her."
"I think Kade might have a shattered self-esteem… That could be what ended his relationship with Delilah, and he’s scared of moving on and starting over with Zay, which is why he’s pushing her away. He doesn’t feel like he deserves someone as good as her, as much as he wants to be with her… The internal conflict is very real 🥺"
"I understand why he is doing what he is doing.   He is trying not to invade her space with his emotions and give her room to explore and discover.  He also doesn’t want to change there relationship at this time.  He is still feeling haunted by his passed.  So much going on.  Yet, he is falling in love with Zay.  I think Zays approach... she is trying to “ clean the past “ to open up room for a future together.  It’s ok to go slow..."
Why do you sound so handsome?! I'm dead.
"This can either go completely wrong, Or completely wrong."
Oh kade just exept your fate already you want Zadia! (Edit) Lmao I just realized that I said exept instead of accept! I have a D in English.
yo she was drawing doodles of Kade I-
cant compare to their beauty! PLZ Zay you're out of this world!✨
Kade is literally pushing her away because he’s scared of his feelings!🥺
"""why do you sound so handsome "" got me, I loved his blushes when she said that ❤"
"You know, i hate what He's doing, but i can relate to Kade. He just doesn't want his love for her to control her life. I've rejected girls simply because I believed I would hold them back or ruin their future. But it still hurts seeing him like that, and Zaida just wants her and Kade to be happy... this web comic about an alien coming to live on earth has me getting way too introspective...   edit: its not been a bunch of girls, maybe 2 or 3, but im not ""capping"" as some might have stated more"
why do I feel like we're going to meet Kade ex very soon
AHHHHHHH POOKIE SENPAI I SAW YOUR CAMEO IN THIS CHAPTER 😱😱😂 I LOVE IT
"“Oh you know, just trying to be independent and determine my entire future,” Just like every day of my life 😂"
Can’t wait for kade to have a nosebleed when Zay models
Fans only….. you think you slick pookie?
I think what Kade said was mature. It’s not healthy to base your entire being around another person. They both need to find their place in this world and find themselves. Healthy relationships only work if both partners are confident and loving towards themselves as well. Relationships are a unity of two grounded people that wish to share their lives with each other. Codependency is not healthy. They each need to be their own person first.
Kade ain’t perfect but I do respect the fact that he is pushing her to be independent and not just taking care of her.  He understands it’s her life and trying to give her the tools she needs to live it on her own.  Of course we all want them together but it needs to be as equals and not as her caretaker
"“Oh nothing, just trying to determine my entire future and become independent” - “Dang girl you sound busy” 😭"
"At this point, Pookie is messing with us…"
is anyone else kinda nervous that the meteor shower from earlier wasn’t just a meteor shower and her becoming a model will just lead them Zodians to her? No? Just me?
"Having been in Kade's position, I get it and I feel for him. It is so hard to move on. But, anyway, as Sebastian said, ""Go on and KISS THE GIRL~"""
so now we know kade has one of those hot gamer boy voices 😏😏
I can’t wait for this to become a live tv series or even an anime❤️❤️❤️
Aah I hope zaida doesn’t get insecure because of the other models because she’s the best queen!!!
Kade’s drawing is the only one not crossed out🥺🥺 that’s so cute
"Dammit Suzy, your making Zaida too ‘out of this world’. People be sus how beautiful she is. Meanwhile Kade just went ‘oh hell no’ one look at her, knowing for a fact she’ll draw the attention of the guys, lol!"
Damn right you want to go
YES YES KADE YOU GO PROTECT HER! MAKE HER YOURS! Edit: Ty for the Love <3
Suzy: *gay panic increasing*
Kade dropped that photo SO FAST
Watch Delilah be there
I KNEW I WAS GETTING LESBIAN VIBES FROM SUZY (or at least bi vibes!)
"Oh good, Kade’s going too. While Zaida has grown a lot, Stace isn’t to be trusted."
hehe my special boy is after them thighs >:]
kade is competing with stace and suzy. a love square 😮
Zay: “what did you think about me when you first met me?” Suzy: *gay panic*
idk I think she looks better without makeup
"Saw how he looked at Zay all gussied up, looked at that photo, and was like screw my past and dropped it like trash. WAY TO GO KADE! MAKE ZAY YOURS!!"
Everyone do be simping for zay and I am too
"Gonna call it now, his ex will be there."
"now kade wants to go, he needs to protek his space waifu got it"
We got a lesbian on our hands.
Dang everyone has the hots for our girl Zaida😅
EVERYONE STAY CALM KADES MOVING ON
ummm... no new fast pass? ARE WE GOING ON HIATUS?
"So Kade likes her, Spencer likes her, and Suzy too! Girl you must be so attractive everyone is the story likes you."
I'm surprised Kade stayed standing because he definitely looked floored when he saw her.
suzy is a lesbian. and she's crushing on zay
