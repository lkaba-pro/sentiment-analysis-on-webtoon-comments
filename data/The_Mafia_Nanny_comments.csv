"Nov 28, 2023",Dont be surprised if it was his own uncle (the don) that killed his wife. I think he wants Mikey to be free from his family. It's like the body guards/employees are watching his every move in the house to report back 👀,85017,87
"Nov 28, 2023",There must be spies within his own household. The ml maybe knows the fl when she was child which would make sense why he pick a newbie than a senior. Edit: it’s the comment section not thesis paper or resume…idc about grammar when comes to comments…,57768,133
"Nov 28, 2023",The Angelini Family seems to have layers of never ending secrets…,40304,46

"Nov 28, 2023",He wants to get his son out. he doesn't want his employees to hear because they will report to the Don. I'm guessing the Don murdered his wife too.,2736,1
"Nov 29, 2023","Ohhhhh he chose her because she grew up part of the life like Mikey, but is also out—HE WANTS HIS SON OUT 😭",1837,1

"Dec 12, 2023",Pretty sure ml doesn't trust his own family and can't fight back if they're threatening his son.

"Nov 28, 2023","We noticed the stuffed ""culprit"" in his backpack🤭",910,0
"Dec 13, 2023",Maybe they should give him ways to listen in/easily contact his father while these meetings occur. Making him go cold turkey isn't gonna work but slowly weaning him off of the mob boss life would be more effective and still make him feel he isn't losing his father.,552,1

"Feb 06, 2024","I think Gabriel chose Davina because he knew her in the past. Those parties Davina mentioned at the beginning, her parents involved in the world of crime might as well mean the people who attended those parties were from the same world. It's quite probable Angelini attended as well. Val saying that Davina reminds her of someone she used to know means that she has known her mother pretty well. Now we know Val and Nico worked with Gabriel up until a year ago. It's all connected from the beginning.",1788,1

"Feb 06, 2024","I had this thought from early on that Gabriel's marriage was arranged and that his wife was on a mission. She then failed her mission (which might have included betraying Gabriel) and once she went ""missing"" Gabriel went looking for her, found her, but also found out the truth, or rather the big lie she was part of. She might've died as a result. That could be a good reason why he's suddenly so protective of Mikey and another reason why the whole incident with his wife has left him so devastated",867,1

"Feb 07, 2024",i love the she literally just woke up from being shot and severe blood loss and she already has more awareness of mikey than these two about him hiding and listening in,216,0
"Feb 06, 2024",In the beginning Gabriel said his wife died yet all they have left is a ring. Even In the first ep he said the mom WASNT AROUND. I'm starting to think the wife left willingly like a divorce or was taken so Gabrielle can be under the bosses thumb!,163,2
"Feb 09, 2024","I DO think Mike’s mom is dead, my biggest question is what does Gabrielle want Davina For?

"Feb 27, 2024",I really feel bad about the cousin. he just wanted to live a life free from the mafia. i’m sure gabriel understands this because i feel like he tried to leave before too and that’s why we see him feeling guilty and poisoning his cousin because he doesn’t want him to suffer. poor davina. she just got reminded she works with the mafia.,6818,2
"Feb 27, 2024","I love how real the characters are. Gabriel realizes how horrible his life is and legimately finds himself caught up between wishing to escape but also protect his son, which makes him so humanly broken and ambivalent. Davina, on her end, does not try to sugarcoat/romanticize anything about the Angelinis just because of her affection for Mikey and her underlying attraction to Gabriel, and stays true to her values and humanity. There are no hearts and flowers, just reality. This story is just🤌🏻",3837,6
"Feb 27, 2024","she is NEVER going to trust him again. as she shouldnt, he betrayed her trust to do something truly horrible. meanwhile gabriel did this because he was covering for davinas hacking into his uncles system because she risked her life to save Mickey on a bad call he made having to let mikey continue going to art class. the DRAMA of it all is SO DELICIOUS",2525,15

"Feb 27, 2024",aw man it sucks that she’ll feel so guilty about it and also think that he probably wanted to do it even tho he didn’t :(( excited too see the birthday card tho <3,449,1

"Mar 05, 2024",Anyone notice how happy Mikey has been lately? He smiles a lot more than he did in the beginning of the series. If Davina left I fear it would absolutely annihilate what is left of his little heart. I also find it strange Davina isn't watching Mikey but he is instead being watched by other family nannies. Which are not to be trusted as far as you can throw them.  I know Davina wants out but I fear the only way she will be able to leave is if she is dead. She would be a liability if she left.,6646,9

"Mar 12, 2024","Okay, after re-reading through the comic, I have a few points. First, Gabriele is almost certainly lying about how much he knows about Davina. He didn’t select her for her cybersecurity skills, he didn’t want to raise red flags in Venice, and there is no other significant reason for him to want cybersecurity as a priority. He knows his wife is dead, so it wouldn’t even be to find her. He chose Davina for a reason, and I think it’s because he knows her background and who she is. (1)",394,0

"Mar 12, 2024","i am going to say gabe is being unfair here. she specifically asked him if there was anything she needed to know cyber security-related in regards to mikeys safety.

"Mar 19, 2024","I think she’s surprised him, but he’s fallen for her because of how much she cares about Mikey. If he doesn’t trust anyone - her civil disobedience towards him for the benefit of Mikey is like catnip for his heart. He can rely on her to prioritize Mikey unlike all the others who want to leverage Mikey’s life/future. I really hope he gets out safe. If he’s injured I could see his family trying to use that as an excuse to take Mikey away",4910,6

"May 07, 2024",I'm glad to know Nico and Val aren't blindly loyal and can see this is stupid on Gabriel's part. Nico can see a shadow of what Gabe is up to. I have no problem with Val having her suspicions because she's not wrong. Davina has an ulterior motive. It's not nefarious but she does have something else she's after. I think picking up on that is good. But I wonder how she'll react when she realizes the name is a plant and a dead end.,408,0
