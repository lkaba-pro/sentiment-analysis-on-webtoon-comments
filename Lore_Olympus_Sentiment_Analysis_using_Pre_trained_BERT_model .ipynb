My spoiler-free review is 6.5 out of 10. Read the series for the art. To be quite honest, none of the characters really stick out to me and at some point the story becomes so convoluted that you cant even tell what exactly is happening. Especially towards the end when they start introducing a lot more characters. Thats my biggest problem with the series I think, is just the severe amount of character bloat. Its not bad, but I wouldnt spend money on it.

I TOTALLY recommend Percy Jackson by Rick Riordan! He is an amazing writer and he gets all the Greek mythology right. He is outstanding at bringing the stories to life and you can see how he dedicates himself to the books he writes through each page as he brings us on a roller coaster of emotions. He is amazing at making me laugh at one moment and then the next, I find myself wrapped in the story, unable to avert my eyes from the action unraveling before my eyes.

I am not buying the idea that Hera and Zeus are a sickeningly sweet couple. Especially when I know that Persephone (who clearly exists in this comic) is an illegitimate daughter of Zeus. Come on, Hera would be mad at Zeus because of his latest cheating escapade. I mean,  I swear that half of Greek myths are caused by Zeus raping everything that moves. Reply 3 0 Grace Anne Boucher Jul 05, 2018 Rereading because I’m having a hard time waiting a week for the next one. The art is so mesmerizing. And I LOVE hades character. He’s so vulnerable and geeky and lonesome.  Good thing a little pink butterfly is gonna flap into his life. When I first clicked on this I was worried it would romanticize the kidnapping myth.

Reply 1 0 Calliecature Dec 06, 2018 Hello, Ive finished reading the latest chapter and well, Ill try to give feedback in each chapter as best as possible. Artstyle: its eye catching with its contrasts and dreamy and sensual with the way it focuses on close-ups with its paint like strokes that are bold with touch of blending here and there. Minthe here is emotionally abusive and Hera seems to have a good relationship with Zeus. Hades here is someone to sympathize on. As a first chapter, the basics of the plot is already in place Reply 1 0 𝓒𝓱𝓪𝓷𝓮𝓵 (◕‿◕✿) Dec 03, 2018 Is it just me or... Has the art style lately been a little... Lazier?

And that she and Zeus are being so lovely. I feel like, in myths, theyre like Diego and Frieda; they have a passionate relationship where theyre either in love or pissing each other off. Its nice not seeing the marriage depicted as loveless for once. Also love how Hera tries to make Hades feel better. Reply 1 0 morico Mar 04, 2018 Congratulations for Lore Olympus being featured! I simply love the little changes in this chapter, especially what Minthe said to Hades about the suits, you can see it really hurt him T_T. And to all who are new to this amazing tale, buckle up because its a fantastic reinterpretation of the myth of Persephone and Hades.

To say that the artwork is mind-bending, is in fact a valid statement. But to trim out the nymph’s face entirely would also be a valid. The symbol she represents, it immediately introduces our protagonist’s desire, something he doesn’t quite have yet. And because she never shows up again, she remains to be THE character whose face shouldn’t be included, to exaggerate her overall symbol linked to Artemis.
